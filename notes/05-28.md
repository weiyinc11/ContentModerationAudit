### Phase 1: Platforms (3 - 4 weeks)
* Identify list of platforms and their content moderation tools 
    * Including Platform link, Account Creation method (Proton Mail), method of creating a closed and controlled experiment environment
* Reading Week 0 Research Papers 
* Testing how auditing platforms needs to be setup for each platform - parsing data 

- [ ] End-of-month report: Describe which latforms chosen and why, Controlled environments for each, and methods of implementing content moderation tool testing
    - Overviews of Testing
    - Free and Paid content moderation tools

### Phase 2: Content

* Curating datasets of toxic content
    * Taken from standardized datasets
    * Curate based on different subtopics and clearly defining between subtopics to measure consistency within each
        * Hate speech relating to Asian Americans vs African Americans
* Defining a clear experimental design
    * Utilizing consistency of content moderation tools against a certain dataset as a quantitative measure
    * Comparing between a pair toxic contents within the question of how well these content moderation tools adhere to the policies provided by platforms
    

### Phase 3: Auditing and Experiments
* Experimenting with to what extent do the content moderation tools adhere to the rules of content moderation policies of identified platforms
