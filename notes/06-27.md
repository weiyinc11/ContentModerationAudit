# Research Meeting - 06/27

Welcome Yash! 
## Review of the Discord Platform findings: 
- Spam Filters also include a machine learning detection tool.

Other features that include machine learning or NLP for moderation tools:
- Safety setup - Automated Explicit Image filter in Discord's AutoMod
- Use of external moderators for 'custom server needs'
- Claims about AutoMod's detection for links to malware

## For Next Week: 
Reading papers and determining the platform's community guidelines or policies that are seemingly difficult to implement using automated content moderation systems. 
Twitch Platform deep dive and tools for audit. 
Fleshing out the Experimental design.
Defining the dataset of harfmul content and methods of feeding that into our server / stream.
