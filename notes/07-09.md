# Meeting Notes:
1. Platform Summary Review and walkthrough Twitch Demos
   - Need to identify the line rate... and recovery time periods
   - Testing chat filters for users and rules-based moderation via a bot
   - How will multiple bots interact with each other? Especially as we are using the britishman420 account as the main account and triggering the bots using a series of command lines.
   - Automate the process of renewing expired access tokens 
  
2. Designing a clear experimental design
   - Need to establish an automated method for feeding harmful content
