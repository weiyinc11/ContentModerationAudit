# Agenda
- Geralyn has mapped out the Twitch moderation structure and what data we may need
- Yash has run the scraper, check in on the process and results
- Key decisions to be made:
    - Are we testing only language or images/video as well? (Both Twitch and Discord have tools for the latter)
    - What are the key metrics to test, i.e. how do we measure effectiveness of moderation?
        - Obv. some fraction, but fraction of what? 
        - Stratify the data by perceived ease of moderation?
- Decide on baseline set of experiments:
    - Twitch 
        - AutoMod (hate speech)
        - Chat filters
    - Discord
        - ?
- Future exploration:
    - Twitch
        - Smart detection (trained based on moderation actions)
