  year = 2003,
  abstract =	 {We introduce captcha, an automated test that humans
                  can pass, but current computer programs can't pass:
                  any program that has high success over a captcha can
                  be used to solve an unsolved Arti - cial
                  Intelligence (AI) problem. We provide several novel
                  constructions of captchas. Since captchas have many
                  applications in practical secu- rity, our approach
                  introduces a new class of hard problems that can be
                  exploited for security purposes. Much like research
                  in cryptography has had a positive impact on
                  algorithms for factoring and discrete log, we hope
                  that the use of hard AI problems for security
                  purposes allows us to advance the  eld of Arti cial
                  Intelligence. We introduce two families of AI
                  problems that can be used to construct captchas and
                  we show that solutions to such problems can be used
                  for steganographic commu- nication. captchas based
                  on these AI problem families, then, imply a win-win
                  situation: either the problems remain unsolved and
                  there is a way to di erentiate humans from
                  computers, or the problems are solved and there is a
                  way to communicate covertly on some channels.},

  title = 		 {Black-Box Analysis of the Block-Cipher-Based Hash-Functions Constructions from {PGV}},
  booktitle =	 {Advances in Cryptology (CRYPTO 2002)},
  year =		 2002,
  abstract =	 { Preneel, Govaerts, and Vandewalle [PGV] considered
                  the 64 most basic ways to construct a hash function
                  H: {0,1}^* -> {0,1}^n from a block cipher E: {0,1}^n
                  x {0,1}^n -> {0,1}^n. They regarded 12 of these 64
                  schemes as secure, though no proofs or formal claims
                  were given. The remaining 52 schemes were shown to
                  be subject to various attacks. Here we provide a
                  formal and quantitative treatment of the 64
                  constructions considered by PGV. We prove that, in a
                  black-box model, the 12 schemes that PGV singled out
                  as secure really are secure: we give tight upper and
                  lower bounds on their collision
                  resistance. Furthermore, by stepping outside of the
                  Merkle-Damgard approach to analysis, we show that an
                  additional 8 of the 64 schemes are just as collision
                  resistant (up to a small constant) as the first
                  group of schemes. Nonetheless, we are able to
                  differentiate among the 20 collision-resistant
                  schemes by bounding their security as one-way
                  functions. We suggest that proving black-box bounds,
                  of the style given here, is a feasible and useful
                  step for understanding the security of any
                  block-cipher-based hash-function construction.},

For example, {``}You are a good woman{''} was considered {``}sexist{''} when trained on an existing dataset. Such model bias is an obstacle for models to be robust enough for practical use. In this work, we measure them on models trained with different datasets, while analyzing the effect of different pre-trained word embeddings and model architectures. We also experiment with three mitigation methods: (1) debiased word embeddings, (2) gender swap data augmentation, and (3) fine-tuning with a larger corpus. These methods can effectively reduce model bias by 90-98{\%} and can be extended to correct model bias in other scenarios.",

Previous research has primarily focused on the development of NLP methods to automatically and effectively detect online hate speech while disregarding further action needed to calm and discourage individuals from using hate speech in the future. In addition, most existing hate speech datasets treat each post as an isolated instance, ignoring the conversational context. In this paper, we propose a novel task of generative hate speech intervention, where the goal is to automatically generate responses to intervene during online conversations that contain hate speech. As a part of this work, we introduce two fully-labeled large-scale hate speech intervention datasets collected from Gab and Reddit. These datasets provide conversation segments, hate speech labels, as well as intervention responses written by Mechanical Turk Workers. In this paper, we also analyze the datasets to understand the common intervention strategies and explore the performance of common automatic response generation methods on these new datasets to provide a benchmark for future research.",

	abstract = {As user-generated content (UGC) on social media becomes near-ubiquitous, the need to review potentially insidious text, images, and video before and after they surface has resulted in the emergence of a new industry in global digital labour: commercial content moderation (CCM). A psychologically taxing job, a handful of scholars and journalists have studied the emotional burden for content moderators in the West, many of whom are predominantly based in Silicon Valley. However, much of this work is increasingly outsourced to the Global South, namely in India and the Philippines. Despite the fact that these overseas moderators filter UGC from Western countries, where the cultural norms on topics like hate speech and sexuality differ from those in Eastern countries like India, the academic research to date has neglected to study foreign content moderators and the ways in which their culture may impact their decision-making processes in reviewing UGC. This thesis takes a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews to study content moderators in India with the objective of understanding not only the country’s booming and rapidly-evolving content moderation industry, but more essentially the subjectivities of Indian moderators and how their culture might influence their work. In addition to presenting novel findings in the general field of CCM, this research ultimately demonstrates that many of the assumptions about Indian content moderators – primarily that they are unable to separate their own cultural upbringings from the US-centric policy guidelines they are meant to uphold – are erroneous and in need of revisiting.},

	abstract = {While it is a popular belief that venting helps unload frustrations about negative (customer) experiences, its effects on consumers' emotional states and consumerbrand forgiveness (CBF) remain to be explored. Given that a lot of customer complaints are made online, brands seem ambivalent about managing these public complaints without violating consumers' right to free speech. In two experiments, we find that writing a customer complaint increases negative emotions regarding an incident. Moreover, brands can mitigate this negative effect by asking consumers to moderate their speech—for example, with the help of a content moderation policy. Specifically, if brands impose restrictions on consumers' freedom to express their frustrations, essentially asking them for self‐censorship, anger levels in their language decrease and CBF increases. We demonstrate that this effect is stronger for consumers with strong self‐brand connection.},

	abstract = {Content moderation is a critical service performed by a variety of people on social media, protecting users from offensive or harmful content by reviewing and removing either the content or the perpetrator. These moderators fall into one of two categories: employees or volunteers. Prior research has suggested that there are differences in the effectiveness of these two types of moderators, with the more transparent user-based moderation being useful for educating users. However, direct comparisons between commerciallymoderated and user-moderated platforms are rare, and apart from the difference in transparency, we still know little about what other disparities in user experience these two moderator types may create. To explore this, we conducted cross-platform surveys of over 900 users of commercially-moderated (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube) and user-moderated (Reddit and Twitch) social media platforms. Our results indicated that although user-moderated platforms did seem to be more transparent than commerciallymoderated ones, this did not lead to user-moderated platforms being perceived as less toxic. In addition, commercially-moderated platform users want companies to take more responsibility for content moderation than they currently do, while user-moderated platform users want designated moderators and those who post on the site to take more responsibility. Across platforms, users seem to feel powerless and want to be taken care of when it comes to content moderation as opposed to engaging themselves.},

Automated hash-matching and predictive machine learning tools – what we define here as algorithmic moderation systems – are increasingly being deployed to conduct content moderation at scale by major platforms for user-generated content such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. This article provides an accessible technical primer on how algorithmic moderation works; examines some of the existing automated tools used by major platforms to handle copyright infringement, terrorism and toxic speech; and identifies key political and ethical issues for these systems as the reliance on them grows. Recent events suggest that algorithmic moderation has become necessary to manage growing public expectations for increased platform responsibility, safety and security on the global stage; however, as we demonstrate, these systems remain opaque, unaccountable and poorly understood. Despite the potential promise of algorithms or ‘AI’, we show that even ‘well optimized’ moderation systems could exacerbate, rather than relieve, many existing problems with content policy as enacted by platforms for three main reasons: automated moderation threatens to (a) further increase opacity, making a famously non-transparent set of practices even more difficult to understand or audit, (b) further complicate outstanding issues of fairness and justice in large-scale sociotechnical systems and (c) re-obscure the fundamentally political nature of speech decisions being executed at scale.},

By the time the reader finds this article, the elements of the assemblages we identify might have shifted, but we hope the framework remains useful for those aiming to understand the relationship between content moderation and long-standing forms of inequality.},

In this article, we present a rich description of Twitter blocklists – why they are needed, how they work, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice. Next, we use blocklists to interrogate online harassment – the forms it takes, as well as tactics used by harassers. Specifically, we interviewed both people who use blocklists to protect themselves, and people who are blocked by blocklists. We find that users are not adequately protected from harassment, and at the same time, many people feel that they are blocked unnecessarily and unfairly. Moreover, we find that not all users agree on what constitutes harassment. Based on our findings, we propose design interventions for social network sites with the aim of protecting people from harassment, while preserving freedom of speech.},

The results from a 304-participant study suggest that the spoken back warning covers may not work as intended, even when converted from text to speech. We controlled for COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy and political leanings and found that the vaccination hesitant Alexa users ignored any type of warning as long as the Tweets align with their personal beliefs. The politically independent users trusted Alexa less then their politically-laden counterparts and that helped them accurately perceiving truthful COVID-19 information. We discuss soft moderation adaptations for voice assistants to achieve the intended effect of curbing COVID-19 misinformation.},

Oﬀensive comments and personal attacks can inhibit participation in these spaces. Automated content moderation aims to overcome this problem using machine learning classiﬁers trained on large corpora of texts manually annotated for oﬀence. While such systems could help encourage more civil debate, they must navigate inherently normatively contestable boundaries, and are subject to the idiosyncratic norms of the human raters who provide the training data. An important objective for platforms implementing such measures might be to ensure that they are not unduly biased towards or against particular norms of oﬀence. This paper provides some exploratory methods by which the normative biases of algorithmic content moderation systems can be measured, by way of a case study using an existing dataset of comments labelled for oﬀence. We train classiﬁers on comments labelled by diﬀerent demographic subsets (men and women) to understand how diﬀerences in conceptions of offence between these groups might aﬀect the performance of the resulting models on various test sets. We conclude by discussing some of the ethical choices facing the implementers of algorithmic moderation systems, given various desired levels of diversity of viewpoints amongst discussion participants.},

In this paper, we present an analysis of user responses to a September 27, 2018 announcement about the quarantine policy on Reddit as a case study of to what extent the discourse on content moderation is polarized by users’ ideological viewpoint. We introduce a novel partitioning approach for characterizing user polarization based on their distribution of participation across interest subreddits. We then use automated techniques for capturing framing to examine how users with different viewpoints discuss moderation issues, ﬁnding that right-leaning users invoked censorship while left-leaning users highlighted inconsistencies on how content policies are applied. Overall, we argue for a more nuanced approach to moderation by highlighting the intersection of behavior and ideology in considering how abusive language is deﬁned and regulated.},

	abstract = {In the moderation and enforcement of copyright content, online platforms as well as internet access service providers play a prominent role. This contribution looks at less prominently addressed “layers” of the internet, namely in relation to the addressing system in form of domain name system (DNS). It first looks at the functioning of the DNS and its location within the content blocking landscape, before contrasting the DNS with linking, which is wellexplored in the copyright jurisprudence and literature, in order to shed light on the role of the DNS in relation to copyright-infringing material. It then turns towards the liability exemption regime of the E-Commerce Directive and the cases of IP address rental and DNS-based content delivery networks. Finally, it looks at the practical role of registration data in the enforcement of copyright and scarce information on “voluntary” arrangements at the DNS-level. The “location” layer of the internet is, compared to online platforms, “far” from copyright-infringing content. Currently, the public consultation in connection with the ongoing review of the E-Commerce Directive under the working title Digital Services Act is touching upon the DNS space. Traditionally, the DNS has not featured prominently in copyright-enforcement debates and it would be wrong to see a prominent role for the DNS going forward. Whereas the “location” layer might be appealing for enforcement purposes, issues and concerns of DNS blocking are manifold and can have serious repercussions on fundamental rights. Yet, already today, there exist voluntary arrangements for the moderation or enforcement of copyright content and the current discussions around the Digital Services Act might be the right place to expand transparency and accountability principles beyond the well-discussed platform enforcement also in the less visible layer of voluntary moderation or enforcement at the “location” layer.},

This article discusses the reported performance of current content moderation technologies from a legal perspective, addressing the following question: what risks do these technologies pose to freedom of expression, access to information and diversity in the digital environment? The legal analysis developed by the article focuses on international human rights law standards. Despite recent improvements, content moderation technologies still fail to understand context, thereby posing risks to users’ free speech, access to information and equality. Consequently, it is concluded, these technologies should not be the sole basis for reaching decisions that directly affect user expression.},

This non-exhaustive statement firmly clashes with the troubling evolution of the algorithmic society where artificial intelligence technologies govern the flow of information online according to opaque technical standards established by social media platforms. These actors are usually neither accountable nor responsible for contents uploaded or generated by the users. Nevertheless, online content moderation affects users’ fundamental rights and democratic values, especially since online platforms autonomously set standards for content removal on a global scale. Despite their crucial role in governing the flow of information online, social media platforms are not required to ensure transparency and explanation of their decision-making processes. Within this framework, this work aims to show how the liberal paradigm of protection of the right to free speech is no longer enough to protect democratic values in the digital environment, since the flow of information is actively organised by business interests, driven by profit-maximisation rather than democracy, transparency or accountability. Although the role of free speech is still paramount, it is necessary to enhance the positive dimension of this fundamental right by establishing new users’ rights in online content moderation based on transparency and accountability of online platforms.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) algorithms are actively used for content moderation in many online discussion platforms to keep up with the large volume of content generated by users everyday. However, most of the time, the existence of algorithms in moderation is opaque to the user. Even when the user knows about the algorithm, it sometimes makes wrong or biased decisions, which makes the user feel unfair and dissatisfied, and reduces their trust on both the algorithm and the moderation process. While improving transparency about the moderation decision could be a solution to address this issue, it can not be fulfilled without improving the algorithmic transparency used in the moderation process. However, the complex nature of the algorithm makes it difficult to design for algorithmic transparency, especially when users do not have any background knowledge on ML algorithm. In this position paper, we briefly discuss the risks, challenges, and design considerations for improving users’ understandability and trust regarding the ML output in content moderation. We also present a discussion interface prototype designed to improve users' understandability and trust on the algorithm by improving moderation transparency and by providing the option of exploring and interacting with the algorithm as people write posts.},

While much of the public discourse surrounding platforms evolves at a policy level between think tanks, journalists, academics and political actors, little attention is paid to how people think about regulation of and by platforms. Through a representative survey study of U.S. internet users (N = 1,022), we explore antecedents of support for social media content moderation by platforms, as well as for regulation of social media platforms by the government. We connect these findings to presumed effects on self (PME1) and others (PME3), concepts that lie at the core of third-person effect (TPE) and influence of presumed influence (IPI) scholarship. We identify third-person perceptions for social media content: Perceived negative effects are stronger for others than for oneself. A first-person perception operates on the platform level: The beneficial effects of social media platforms are perceived to be stronger for the self than for society. At the behavioral level, we identify age, education, opposition to censorship, and perceived negative effects of social media content on others (PME3) as significant predictors of support for content moderation. Concerning support for regulation of platforms by the government, we find significant effects of opposition to censorship, perceived intentional censorship, frequency of social media use, and trust in platforms. We argue that stakeholders involved in platform governance must take more seriously the attitudes of their constituents.},

This article explores content moderation’s effect on mashup music – a form of remix which relies primarily on the unauthorised combining of pre-existing, recognisable recordings. Drawing on interviews (n = 30) and an online survey (n = 92) with mashup producers, we show that content moderation affects producers’ creative decisions and distribution strategies, and has a strong negative effect on their overall motivation to create mashups. The objections that producers hold to this state of affairs often strongly resonate with current copyright exceptions. However, we argue that these exceptions, which form a legal ‘grey zone’, are currently unsatisfactorily accommodated for by platforms. Platforms’ political-economic power allows them, in effect, to ‘occupy’ and control this zone. Consequently, the practical efficacy of copyright law’s exceptions in this setting is significantly reduced.},

Using pro-eating disorder (pro-ED) communities as a case study, this article explores the practices of circumventing hashtag moderation in online pro-ED communities. It shows how (1) untagged pro-ED content can be found without using the hashtag as a search mechanism; (2) users are evading hashtag and other forms of platform policing, devising signals to identify themselves as “pro-ED”; and (3) platforms’ recommendation systems recirculate pro-ED content, revealing the limitations of hashtag logics in social media content moderation.},

However, not all expressions of mental illness are treated equally on these platforms. Different aggregates of human and technical control are used to report and ban content, accounts, and communities. Through two years of digital ethnography, including online observation and interviews, with people with eating disorders, we examine the experience of content moderation. We use a constructivist grounded theory approach to analysis that shows how practices of moderation across different platforms have particular consequences for members of marginalized groups, who are pressured to conform and compelled to resist. Above all, we argue that platform moderation is enmeshed with wider processes of conformity to specific versions of mental illness. Practices of moderation reassert certain bodies and experiences as 'normal' and valued, while rejecting others. At the same time, navigating and resisting these normative pressures further inscribes the marginal status of certain individuals. We discuss changes to the ways that platforms handle content related to eating disorders by drawing on the concept of multiplicity to inform design.},

	abstract = {Transparency in moderation practices is crucial to the success of an online community. To meet the growing demands of transparency and accountability, several academics came together and proposed the Santa Clara Principles on Transparency and Accountability in Content Moderation (SCP). In 2018, Reddit, home to uniquely moderated communities called subreddits, announced in its transparency report that the company is aligning its content moderation practices with the SCP. But do the moderators of subreddit communities follow these guidelines too? In this paper, we answer this question by employing a mixed-methods approach on public moderation logs collected from 204 subreddits over a period of five months, containing more than 0.5M instances of removals by both human moderators and AutoModerator. Our results reveal a lack of transparency in moderation practices. We find that while subreddits often rely on AutoModerator to sanction newcomer posts based on karma requirements and moderate uncivil content based on automated keyword lists, users are neither notified of these sanctions, nor are these practices formally stated in any of the subreddits' rules. We interviewed 13 Reddit moderators to hear their views on different facets of transparency and to determine why a lack of transparency is a widespread phenomenon. The interviews reveal that moderators' stance on transparency is divided, there is a lack of standardized process to appeal against content removal and Reddit's app and platform design often impede moderators' ability to be transparent in their moderation practices.},

Through a study where we ask crowd workers to moderate tweets, we demonstrate that crowdsourcing is a promising solution for content moderation. We also report a strong relationship between the sentiment of a tweet and its appropriateness to appear in public media. Our analysis on worker responses further reveals several key factors that affect the judgement of crowd moderators when deciding on the suitability of text content.

We identify gaps in knowledge through a thematic analysis of 380 survey responses from individuals who have been the subject of content moderation decisions. We argue that meaningful transparency should be understood as a component of a communicative process of accountability (rendering account) to independent stakeholders. We make specific recommendations for platforms to provide people with clear information about decisions that affect them, including what content is moderated, which rule was breached, and a description of the people and automated processes responsible for identifying content and making the decision. Beyond providing more information to individuals about particular decisions, however, we note the major challenge of improving understanding of content moderation at a systems level. General demands for greater transparency should be reframed to focus on enhanced access to large-scale disaggregated data that can enable new methods and collaborations among academia, civil society, and journalists to make these systems more understandable and accountable.},

Drawing from a series of interviews with individuals in the “Men Are Scum” movement, this article describes the experiences of women who have been censored on Facebook and explores whether self-regulatory processes on this platform are distinctly gendered. It asserts that both explicit censorship (e.g., limited displays of the body) and implicit censorship (e.g., rampant and unchecked hate speech silencing women’s voices) are operative on Facebook, limiting women’s expressive potentiality. Thus, this article proposes the term “gender-based censorship” as a lens through which to understand women’s experiences on Facebook. These findings help reveal the pitfalls of industry self-regulation in which profit motives are prioritized over protection of users (especially those who may be marginalized offline).},

Hitherto, this allegation has been made based on anecdotes rather than logical reasoning and empirical evidence, which motivates us to audit its validity. In this paper, we ﬁrst introduce two formal criteria to measure bias (i.e., independence and separation) and their contextual meanings in content moderation, and then use YouTube as a lens to investigate if the political leaning of a video plays a role in the moderation decision for its associated comments. Our results show that when justiﬁable target variables (e.g., hate speech and extremeness) are controlled with propensity scoring, the likelihood of comment moderation is equal across left- and right-leaning videos.},

To address this problem, the platforms implement content moderation using a mix of human and algorithmic processes. However, content moderation itself has lead to further accusations against the platforms of political bias. In this study, we investigate how channel partisanship and video misinformation affect the likelihood of comment moderation on YouTube. Using a dataset of 84,068 comments on 258 videos, we ﬁnd that although comments on right-leaning videos are more heavily moderated from a correlational perspective, we ﬁnd no evidence to support claims of political bias when using a causal model that controls for common confounders (e.g., hate speech). Additionally, we ﬁnd that comments are more likely to be moderated if the video channel is ideologically extreme, if the video content is false, and if the comments were posted after a fact-check.},

Due to the private encrypted nature of the messages on WhatsApp, it is hard to track the dissemination of misinformation at scale.

This represents a signiﬁcant portion of misinformation spread in both Brazil and India in the groups analyzed. We posit that such misinformation content could be prevented if WhatsApp had a means to ﬂag already fact-checked content. To this end, we propose an architecture that could be implemented by WhatsApp to counter such misinformation. Our proposal respects the current endto-end encryption architecture on WhatsApp, thus protecting users’ privacy while providing an approach to detect the misinformation that beneﬁts from fact-checking eﬀorts.},

This conversation has grave implications for communities that often find themselves an afterthought in technology design, and who coincidentally could benefit most from technological interventions in response to societal oppression. To explore this topic, we examined “futuring” through co-designed speculative design fictions as methods to envision utopian and dystopian futures. In a case study, we examined technology’s role in the imagined futures of youth participants of a Chicago summer design program. We highlight emerging themes and contribute an analysis of remote co-design through an Afrofuturism lens. Our analysis shows that concepts of utopian futures and technologies to support those futures are still heavily laden with dystopian realities of racism and poverty. We discuss ways that speculative design fictions and futuring can serve to address inclusivity in concept generation for new technologies, and we provide recommendations for conducting design techniques remotely with historically excluded populations.},

On the popular social media site Reddit, moderators heavily rely on a configurable, automated program called ‘Automoderator’ (or ‘Automod’). How do moderators use Automod? What advantages and challenges does the use of Automod present? We participated as Reddit moderators for over a year, and conducted interviews with 16 moderators to understand the use of Automod in the context of the sociotechnical system of Reddit. Our findings suggest a need for audit tools to help tune the performance of automated mechanisms, a repository for sharing tools, and improving the division of labor between human and machine decision making.

Our findings characterize the types of rules across Reddit, the frequency of rules at scale, and patterns of rules based on subreddit characteristics.

Taken together, our findings provide a rich description of this ecosystem of rules, motivating further inquiry into underlying mechanisms for rule formation and enforcement in online communities.},

I investigate this by analyzing a protest against the social news platform reddit by moderators of 2,278 subreddit communities in July 2015. These moderators collectively disabled their subreddits, preventing millions of readers from accessing major parts of reddit and convincing the company to negotiate over their demands. This paper oﬀers a descriptive analysis of the protest, combining qualitative content analysis, interviews, and quantitative analysis with the population of 52,735 active subreddits. Through participatory hypotheses testing with moderators, this study reveals social factors including the grievances of moderators, relations with platform operators, relations among moderators, subreddit resources, subreddit isolation, and moderators’ relations with their subreddits that can lead to participation in mass collective action against a platform.},

This is especially true in creative spaces where rules about reuse and remix are notoriously gray. Based on a content analysis of public forum postings in eight different online communities featuring different media types (music, video, art, and writing), we found that copyright is a frequent topic of conversation and that much of this discourse stems from problems that copyright causes for creative activities. We identify the major types of problems encountered, including chilling effects that negatively impact technology use. We find that many challenges can be explained by lack of knowledge about legal or policy rules, including breakdowns in user expectations for the sites they use. We argue that lack of clarity is a pervasive usability problem that should be considered more carefully in the design of user-generated content platforms.},

Policy, including intellectual property rights, is a necessary but often invisible part of online content sharing and social computing environments. We analyzed the copyright licenses contained in the Terms of Service of 30 different websites where users contribute content, then conducted a survey to match perceptions of copyright terms to the reality. We found that licensing terms vary in unpredictable ways, and that user expectations and opinions differ by license and by type of website. Moreover, the most undesirable terms, such as right to modify, appear more frequently than users expect. We argue that users care about how their content can be used yet lack critical information. Site designers should take user needs and community norms into account in creating and explaining copyright policies.},

This study examined five–eight-year-old children’s understanding of dangers associated with the Internet, management strategies and sources of their understanding. Children in small groups answered questions relating to what they consider dangerous interactions or materials connected with the Internet, management strategies they would employ if confronted with these, and who taught them what they knew. Many children reported prior negative experiences on the Internet. Although they identified several risk categories, when presented with potentially dangerous Internet interactions almost half were not able to identify the associated risks. Most children identified appropriate management strategies; however, it was evident that children could not safely employ these because they were unable to recognize potential dangers. Just under half of the children indicated they had not been taught Internet safety. Internet risks for children can be reduced through education in their recognition of potential dangers, recall and management strategies, indicating a need for schools to incorporate Internet safety into curricula.},

A four-year old child may not posses the manual dexterity to operate a complex internet game; an eight-year old's growing ability to reason logically gives him the opportunity to take part in strategy-based activities and contests; twelve-year old preteens may be put off by a topic they believe to be "uncool." The following article provides a brief summary of the developmental stages of children and young teens -- from age two to age fourteen -- and the relationship of these stages to kids' use of electronic media.

Drawing on 102 interviews with parents, we investigate how parents decide what to disclose about their children on social network sites (SNSs). We find that mothers take on the responsibility of sharing content about their children more than fathers do. Fathers are more restrictive about sharing to broad and professional audiences and are concerned about sharing content that could be perceived as sexually suggestive. Both mothers and fathers work to leverage affordances of SNSs to limit oversharing. Building on prior work, we introduce the concept of parental disclosure management, which describes how parents decide what to share about their children online. We also describe an emerging third shift of work that highlights the additional work parents take on to manage children’s identities online. We conclude with theoretical and practical implications for designing SNSs to better support family life online.},

Limited empirical research focuses on the role and impact of parents in this context. In the present study, Internet parenting styles are deﬁned and operationalized to study the impact on actual Internet usage of children at home. Two dimensions are distinguished in Internet parenting styles: parental control and parental warmth. Based on a survey, involving 533 parents from children in primary schools, this Internet usage was studied from the perspective of Internet parenting styles. Results point at high Internet access at home. As to the parenting styles, we observe a dominance of the authoritative parenting style (59.4\%). The styles differ when controlling for parent gender, educational background and age. Parenting styles are also linked to level of parent Internet usage, Internet attitude and Internet experience. Parenting styles also signiﬁcantly affect child Internet usage. The highest child usage level is perceived when parents adopt a permissive parenting style; the lowest level is observed when parents adopt an authoritarian Internet parenting style. The variables Internet parenting style, parent Internet behavior, and parent educational background signiﬁcantly predict Internet usage of children at home (R2 ¼ .44). Theoretical and practical implications are discussed and directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Parents and children both use technology actively and increasingly, but prior work shows that concerns about attention, family time, and family relationships abound. We conducted a survey with 249 parent-child pairs distributed across 40 U.S. states to understand the types of technology rules (also known as restrictive mediation) they have established in their family and how effective those rules are perceived to be. Our data robustly show that children (age 1017) are more likely to follow rules that constrain technology activities (e.g., no Snapchat) than rules that constrain technology use in certain contexts (e.g., no phone at the dinner table). Children find context constraints harder to live up to, parents find them harder to enforce, and parents’ most common challenge when trying to enforce such rules is that children “can’t put it down.” This is consistent with the idea that banning certain technologies is currently easier than setting more nuanced boundaries. Parents and children agree that parents should also unplug when spending time with family, while children alone express frustration with the common parent practice of posting about children online. Together, our results suggest several mechanisms by which designers and families can improve parent-child relationships around technology use.},

However, research on kids' wearables is sparse and often focuses on their use in the context of parental surveillance. To gain insight into the current landscape of kids' wearables, we surveyed 47 wearable devices marketed for children. We collected rich data on the functionality of these devices and assessed how different features satisfy parents' information needs, and identified opportunities for wearables to support children's needs and interests. We found that many kids' wearables are technologically sophisticated devices that focus on parents' ability to communicate with their children and keep them safe, as well as encourage physical activity and nurture good habits. We discuss how our findings could inform the design of wearables that serve as more than monitoring devices, and instead support children and parents as equal stakeholders, providing implications for kids' agency, long-term development, and overall well-being. Finally, we identify future research efforts related to designing for kids' self-tracking and collaborative tracking with parents.},

To illustrate our premise, we applied the theoretical lens of information ecology to analyze a case study of Open Learning Exchange (OLE) which has been described as one of the few successes in implementing OLPC. Based on our analysis, we posit that information ecology is a suitable and appropriate lens to interpret and understand how IT interventions can be successfully deployed in developing countries.},

This paper is concerned with ways of enhancing peer-to-peer learning affordances in library spaces; how can the library facilitate the community of library users to learn from each other? We report on the findings of a study that employed a participatory design method where participants were asked to reflect and draw places, social networks, and activities that they use to work (be creative, productive), play (have fun, socialize, be entertained), and learn (acquire new information, knowledge, or skills). The results illustrate how informal learning – learning outside the formal education system – is facilitated by a personal selection of physical and socio-cultural environments, as well as online tools, platforms, and networks. This paper sheds light on participants’ individually curated ecologies of their work, play, and learning related networks and the hybrid (physical and digital) nature of these places. These insights reveal opportunities for ambient media architecture to increase awareness of and connections between people’s hybrid personal learning environments.},

In our ﬁrst study, we share data on students’ learning as a function of the required introductory course and their pre-course history of technological experience. In order to go beyond traditional assessments of learning we assessed two aspects of students’ ‘‘learning ecologies’’: their use of a variety of learning resources and the extent to which they share their knowledge about technology with others. In our second study we present patterns of course taking by male and female students who have almost completed their secondary schooling. In addition, we share case studies of students who elected to take more technology classes and leveraged their course experiences for internships, further education, and jobs. The quantitative and qualitative data are consistent with our hypothesis that students would become more technologically ﬂuent and that their learning ecologies would diversify as a result of their project-based experiences.},

Primary school teachers are required to present parents with an end of year school report, which often represents the only real information parents receive. While the government assumes that teachers‘ communication with parents can improve through the use of computerised systems and report writing software, the evidence appears to point to primary schools and parents rejecting the use of technological communication as insufficiently personal and informative. The Government assumes that schools will implement highly sophisticated technology while it presumes that parents and teachers approach their communication from a level power base and equal technological ability. Thus the school systems reinforce social and class differences.},

User studies were conducted in five schools in rural Gujarat to identify challenges and opportunities in such schools. Analysis of such studies surfaced circumstances ranging from class combination and spatial movements of students, to unavailability of teachers, and less instruction time. These gave insights regarding students‟ behavior in groups, spatial arrangements, importance of tangible artifacts, and interaction among peers. The paper discusses design opportunities especially from the point of view of HCI community. It throws light upon insights, design implications, and in few cases design ideas.},

However, sharing or analysis of this data introduce privacy risks for the data subjects, mostly students. Existing work in the learning analytics literature identiﬁes the need for privacy and pose interesting research directions, but fails to apply state of the art privacy protection methods with quantiﬁable and mathematically rigorous privacy guarantees. This work aims to employ and evaluate such methods on learning analytics by approaching the problem from two perspectives: (1) the data is anonymized and then shared with a learning analytics expert, and (2) the learning analytics expert is given a privacy-preserving interface that governs her access to the data. We develop proof-of-concept implementations of privacy preserving learning analytics tasks using both perspectives and run them on real and synthetic datasets. We also present an experimental study on the trade-off between individuals’ privacy and the accuracy of the learning analytics tasks.},

While big data and analytics are not panaceas for addressing all of the issues and decisions faced by higher education administrators, they can become part of the solutions integrated into administrative and instructional functions. The purpose of this article is to examine the evolving world of big data and analytics in American higher education. Specifically, it will look at the nature of these concepts, provide basic definitions, consider possible applications, and last but not least, identify concerns about their implementation and growth.},

	abstract = {This study examines high school students’ perceptions of school closedcircuit television systems (CCTVs). It draws on interviews conducted with 83 adolescents recruited from 10th- to 12th-grade classes at 39 Israeli schools. The findings indicate that students’ perceptions of CCTVs are embedded in their overall opinions about their school, particularly concerning relationships and trust between students and educators. The various metaphors that students used to describe their relational position regarding school CCTVs highlight that surveillance has become part of the organizational–educational experience. The findings also show that students’ scrutiny of school CCTVs reflects a conflict between privacy and security concerns. Students resolve this conflict by resorting to various balances, which echo general constitutional principles but were also anchored in the students’ personal schooling experiences. While building on Nissenbaum’s framework of contextual integrity for assessing privacy violations, we challenge its assumption of a uniform set of informational norms within a given context.},

	abstract = {Educational data contains valuable information that can be harvested through learning analytics to provide new insights for a better education system. However, sharing or analysis of this data introduce privacy risks for the data subjects, mostly students. Existing work in the learning analytics literature identiﬁes the need for privacy and pose interesting research directions, but fails to apply state of the art privacy protection methods with quantiﬁable and mathematically rigorous privacy guarantees. This work aims to employ and evaluate such methods on learning analytics by approaching the problem from two perspectives: (1) the data is anonymized and then shared with a learning analytics expert, and (2) the learning analytics expert is given a privacy-preserving interface that governs her access to the data. We develop proof-of-concept implementations of privacy preserving learning analytics tasks using both perspectives and run them on real and synthetic datasets. We also present an experimental study on the trade-off between individuals’ privacy and the accuracy of the learning analytics tasks.},

While big data and analytics are not panaceas for addressing all of the issues and decisions faced by higher education administrators, they can become part of the solutions integrated into administrative and instructional functions. The purpose of this article is to examine the evolving world of big data and analytics in American higher education. Specifically, it will look at the nature of these concepts, provide basic definitions, consider possible applications, and last but not least, identify concerns about their implementation and growth.},

By examining analytics-based pivotal turns, centralities, and knowledge building discourse moves, this analysis reveals different patterns of knowledge building trajectories among high-, medium-, and low-contribution groups, as well as the role of Idea-Friend Maps in scaffolding collective knowledge creation. We also examined how students co-designed and used the collective journey to sustain their knowledge creation, with the aid of Idea-Friend Maps. This study sheds light on using opportunistic groups and learning analytics approach to examine and to scaffold student knowledge building trajectories in collective inquiry and ways of fostering collective knowledge creation in large communities.},

In contrast, "design" in HCI is comprised of rich and complex concepts and practices, but has received much less attention in the PBD context. Conducting a literature review of HCI publications discussing privacy and design, this paper articulates a set of dimensions along which design relates to privacy, including: the purpose of design, which actors do design work in these settings, and the envisioned benefciaries of design work. We suggest new roles for HCI and design in PBD research and practice: utilizing valuesand critically-oriented design approaches to foreground social values and help defne privacy problem spaces. We argue such approaches, in addition to current "design to solve privacy problems" eforts, are essential to the full realization of PBD, while noting the politics involved when choosing design to address privacy.},

Individual interviews (n=20) were conducted with Swedish children to gain insight into their views and practices regarding advertising on the internet. The interview results are interpreted in relation to de Certeau’s (1984) theory of practices in everyday life, and New dimensions regarding the concept of tactics are highlighted in the conclusion. The results suggest that children have an ambivalent or negative view of online advertising. They report on avoidance tactics used in order to escape advertisements, but they also sometimes find it difficult to cope with advertisements due to their frequent appearance, color and motion. The children also report on their uses of online advertising as entertainment, and the authors stress the need for policymakers to consider whether the regulatory framework for broadcasting could be extended to cover online advertising.},

	abstract = {The C1 billion government drive to integrate information and communications technology (ICT) into UK schools and colleges has been "rmly focused on the technological transformation of the teaching profession. In particular, the establishment of a National Grid for Learning (NGfL) remains dependent on the successful \&selling' of ICT to teachers; many of whom have previously proved unwilling to use computers. In practice much of this task has been left to IT "rms, eager to promote their products to a potentially lucrative educational marketplace. From this basis the present paper takes a detailed examination of educational computing advertising material currently being produced by IT "rms in the UK. In particular it concentrates on how advertisements construct both the process of education and the teacher as a potential user of ICT. Four dominant themes emerge from this analysis: ICT as problematic for teachers; ICT as a problem solver for teachers; ICT as a futuristic form of education; and ICT as a traditional form of education. Despite the con\#icting, and often contra-factual, nature of these four discourses the paper argues that educational computing advertising is consistent in its disempowering portrayal of the teacher at the expense of both the computer and IT "rm. This \&demotion' of the teacher is likely to have negative e!ects on the way that teachers approach ICT as part of their professional routine, running contrary to the underlying aims of the National Grid for Learning initiative. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Selling in-game content has become a popular revenue model for game publishers. While prior research has investigated latent motivations as determinants of in-game content purchases, the prior literature has not focused on more concrete reasons to purchase in-game content that stem from how the games are being designed. We form an inventory of reasons (19) to buy in-game content via triangulating from analyses of top-grossing free-to-play games, from a review of existing research, and from industry expert input. These reasons were operationalized into a survey (N ¼ 519). Firstly, we explored how these motivations converged into categories. The results indicated that the purchasing reasons converged into six dimensions: 1) Unobstructed play, 2) Social interaction, 3) Competition, 4) Economical rationale, 5) Indulging the children, and 6) Unlocking content. Secondly, we investigated the relationship between these factors and how much players spend money on in-game content. The results revealed that the purchase motivations of unobstructed play, social interaction, and economical rationale were positively associated with how much money players spend on in-game content. The results imply that the way designers implement artiﬁcial limitations and obstacles as well as social interaction affects how much players spend money on in-game content.},

Despite federal regulations requiring content creators to disclose online endorsements, studies suggest that less than 10\% do so in practice. To overcome this issue, we need knowledge of how to best detect online endorsements, knowledge about how prevalent online endorsements are in the wild, and ways to design systems to automatically disclose advertising content to viewers. To that end, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a tool called AdIntuition which automatically discloses when YouTube videos contain afﬁliate marketing, a type of social media endorsement. We evaluated AdIntuition with 783 users using a survey, ﬁeld deployment, and diary study. We discuss our ﬁndings and recommendations for future measurements of and tools to detect and alert users about afﬁliate marketing content.},

In contrast, I could not confirm a corresponding influence of the enjoyment of routine tasks on in-app purchase intention.

As a result, children and adolescents are now the target of intense and specialized food marketing and advertising efforts. Food marketers are interested in youth as consumers because of their spending power, their purchasing influence, and as future adult consumers. Multiple techniques and channels are used to reach youth, beginning when they are toddlers, to foster brand-building and influence food product purchase behavior. These food marketing channels include television advertising, in-school marketing, product placements, kids clubs, the Internet, toys and products with brand logos, and youth-targeted promotions, such as cross-selling and tie-ins. Foods marketed to children are predominantly high in sugar and fat, and as such are inconsistent with national dietary recommendations. The purpose of this article is to examine the food advertising and marketing channels used to target children and adolescents in the US, the impact of food advertising on eating behavior, and current regulation and policies.},

Most of the digital services oﬀered on the internet are advertising funded, which makes advertising ubiquitous in children’s everyday life. To understand the impact of advertising-based digital services on children, we study the collective behavior of users of YouTube for kids channels and present the demographics of a large number of users. We collected data from 12,848 videos from 17 channels in US and UK and 24 channels in Brazil. The channels in English have been viewed more than 37 billion times. We also collected more than 14 million comments made by users. Based on a combination of text-analysis and face recognition tools, we show the presence of racial and gender biases in our large sample of users. We also identify children actively using YouTube, although the minimum age for using the service is 13 years in most countries. We provide comparisons of user behavior among the three countries, which represent large user populations in the global North and the global South.},

We argue that this positions teachers as surveillant consumers who use monitoring as a way to fulfill their responsibilities to students. We portray two configurations of monitoring in the classroom: tracking student learning and keeping students on task. These configurations reveal how technology platforms orient teachers to see student data as interchangeable with students, which we believe highlights the need for greater scrutiny of technology platforms’ role in the classroom.},

	abstract = {Advertisers are continuously searching for new ways to persuade children, thereby fully integrating commercial content into media content, actively engaging children with the commercial content, and enlarging the amount of commercial messages a child is confronted with at one moment in time. This poses a challenge for how children cope with embedded advertising. This conceptual paper aims to develop a theoretically grounded framework for investigating how children process embedded advertising. More precisely, it sheds a light on previous research and conceptualizations of advertising literacy and provides suggestions for future research. In particular, attention is devoted to conceptual and methodological issues, as well as to the need for research on how to improve children’s coping with embedded advertising, by emphasizing the value of persuasive intent priming and implementation intentions. To conclude, future research directions are discussed regarding strategies to strengthen children’s dispositional (i.e. associative network consisting of cognitive, moral and affective beliefs related to advertising) and situational (i.e. actual recognition of and critical reflection on advertising) advertising literacy, and their coping skills.},

She wonders whether the youngest, who has never video-conferenced before, will recognise and talk to her. These children are growing up with a game changer.

As children are stakeholders in such technologies, recent research has called for their inclusion in its design process. To investigate children’s perceptions of parental mobile monitoring technologies and explore their interaction preferences, we held two co-design sessions with 12 children ages 7-12. Children first reviewed and redesigned an existing mobile monitoring application. Next, they designed ways children could use monitoring software when they encounter mobile risks (e.g., cyberbullying, inappropriate content). Results showed that children acknowledged safety needs and accepted certain parental controls. They preferred and designed controls that emphasized restriction over monitoring, taught risk coping, promoted parent-child communication, and automated interactions. Our results benefit designers looking to develop parental mobile monitoring technologies in ways that children will both accept and can actively benefit from.},

Prior work has considered the educational and pedagogical implications of technology use, but little research has examined how educators consider privacy and security in relation to classroom technology use. To better understand what privacy and security mean to elementary school educators, we conducted nine focus groups with 25 educators across three metropolitan regions in the northeast U.S. Our findings suggest that technology use is an integral part of elementary school classrooms, that educators consider digital privacy and security through the lens of curricular and classroom management goals, and that lessons to teach children about digital privacy and security are rare. Using Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory, we identify design opportunities to help educators integrate privacy and security into decisions about digital technology use and to help children learn about digital privacy and security.},

These monetization mechanisms often have deceptive elements and closely resemble what designers know as Dark Patterns. In-app advertising and purchasing have been studied with adults but, to-date, younger users have received comparatively little consideration despite their increased susceptibility to manipulation. This paper addresses the gap in research by creating the ADD (App Dark Design) framework which brings together insights from practitioners, theory from existing related research, and the findings from a user study which gathered qualitative data from 39 girls aged 12-13 years. We also derive a set of emerging issues and identify future research questions. This work is the first of its kind to create a framework to support the critical consideration of the design of free-to-play apps. We have identified a set of problematic Dark Design aspects that young people across the world are encountering in their apps every day and we hope this paper will both raise awareness and stimulate further research work on this important topic.},

It focuses on the role of and relationships between consumer culture, media culture and education culture in the construction of generational differences, and what these mean for the nature and purposes of contemporary education. Generations and inter-generational relations articulate in very complex ways with consumer, media and contemporary school cultures. This poses dilemmas for teachers and students in current school settings, and these dilemmas should be understood and resolved, if schools are to connect properly to the young people of today and tomorrow.},

	abstract = {Digital and mobile games are an important part of many children’s daily media usage and are used by children for, among other things, entertainment and relaxation purposes. Mobile games are commonly ‘free-to-play’ and have revenue models based on in-app purchases and advertising. These revenue models affect the content and structure of mobile games and, consequently, also the gaming experiences. Drawing on group interviews with 9- and 12-year-old children, this article analyses how children view and engage with advertising in mobile games, and what consequences in-game advertising have for children’s game experiences. The results show that children’s engagement with in-game advertising takes the form of a struggle and that children both resist and resign themselves to the advertising strategies. Advertising brings about negative experiences of deception, enforcement and confrontation, and interrupts moments of enjoyment, achievement and immersion during gameplay. These results suggest that playing advertising-based free-to-play mobile games is a demanding environment for children.},

	abstract = {Objective: Young children use mobile devices on average 1 hour/day, but no studies have examined the prevalence of advertising in children’s apps. The objective of this study was to describe the advertising content of popular children’s apps. Methods: To create a coding scheme, we downloaded and played 39 apps played by children aged 12 months to 5 years in a pilot study of a mobile sensing app; 2 researchers played each app, took detailed notes on the design of advertisements, and iteratively refined the codebook (interrater reliability 0.96). Codes were then applied to the 96 most downloaded free and paid apps in the 5 And Under category on the Google Play app store. Results: Of the 135 apps reviewed, 129 (95\%) contained at least 1 type of advertising. These included use of commercial characters (42\%); full-app teasers (46\%); advertising videos interrupting play (e.g., pop-ups [35\%] or to unlock play items [16\%]); in-app purchases (30\%); prompts to rate the app (28\%) or share on social media (14\%); distracting ads such as banners across the screen (17\%) or hidden ads with misleading symbols such as “\$” or camouflaged as gameplay items (7\%). Advertising was significantly more prevalent in free apps (100\% vs 88\% of paid apps), but occurred at similar rates in apps labeled as “educational” versus other categories. Conclusion: In this exploratory study, we found high rates of mobile advertising through manipulative and disruptive methods. These results have implications for advertising regulation, parent media choices, and apps’ educational value.},

	abstract = {Children are important targets of advertising campaigns from companies. However, children have been found to be particularly vulnerable to negative effects of advertising, and protecting children from these effects is an important task of consumer policy. Two important aspects have to be considered in this task. First, advertising affects judgements and behaviour not only during ad exposure but also in delayed consumption and purchase contexts. Second, advertising operates largely at an implicit level—during ad exposure as well as in consumption decisions. The current article introduces a dual-step (ad exposure vs. purchase/consumption) and dual-process (implicit vs. explicit) model of advertising effects on children. The model is based on a review of implicit advertising effects and implicit mechanisms of self-control. It implies that consumer policies intending to prevent undesired advertising effects should support interventions that strengthen advertising and purchasing literacy and, in addition, implicit self-control mechanisms in children. As self-control in consumption decisions is largely relevant for, and learned during, shopping and consumption, such interventions should focus on educating parents or other primary caregivers because they are the most likely persons to accompany children in such situations and have a great influence on children's implicit learning.},

Finally, signiﬁcant differences were observed when comparing the use of verbal and cued methods. The results are discussed in terms of prior literature and their practical implications.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES. The objectives of this study were to describe media access and use among US children aged 0 to 6, to assess how many young children fall within the American Academy of Pediatrics media-use guidelines, to identify demographic and family factors predicting American Academy of Pediatrics media-use guideline adherence, and to assess the relation of guideline adherence to reading and playing outdoors.
METHODS. Data from a representative sample of parents of children aged 0 to 6 (N ϭ 1051) in 2005 were used. Descriptive analyses, logistic regression, and multivariate analyses of covariance were used as appropriate.
RESULTS. On a typical day, 75\% of children watched television and 32\% watched videos/DVDs, for approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes, on average. New media are also making inroads with young children: 27\% of 5- to 6-year-olds used a computer (for 50 minutes on average) on a typical day. Many young children (one ﬁfth of 0- to 2-year-olds and more than one third of 3- to 6-year-olds) also have a television in their bedroom. The most common reason given was that it frees up other televisions in the house so that other family members can watch their own shows (54\%). The majority of children aged 3 to 6 fell within the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, but 70\% of 0- to 2-year-olds did not.
CONCLUSIONS. This study is the ﬁrst to provide comprehensive information regarding the extent of media use among young children in the United States. These children are growing up in a media-saturated environment with almost universal access to television, and a striking number have a television in their bedroom. Media and technology are here to stay and are virtually guaranteed to play an ever-increasing role in daily life, even among the very young. Additional research on their developmental impact is crucial to public health.},

	abstract = {The alarming increase in childhood obesity has captured the attention of a broad set of citizens and institutions, with calls for action becoming increasingly powerful. Particular questions are being raised about the impacts of food marketing on children. The Internet has become an important marketing communications tool and is being used by advertisers to target children. This has prompted calls for a review of online marketing practices from public health officials, policy makers, consumer advocates, and industry groups. The objectives of this study are to inform decision makers about the nature of online marketing to children and to identify practices that may raise policy concerns. The authors report results of the first systematic content analysis of food marketers’ Web sites that either target children directly or contain content of interest to them. The authors identify 11 online marketing practices of public policy relevance. They discuss the empirical findings in terms of these issues and outline research needs.},

	abstract = {Parents are recognized as an important group of stakeholders to take into account when implementing technology in schools. However, very little research has considered the parent‟s view in the learning development of his/her child, when introducing technology. This paper addresses this gap by presenting the findings of an inductive study to improve the understanding of parents‟ perceptions on the adoption of technology in their child‟s learning environment. A qualitative study was done with data gathered through an online anonymous questionnaire containing open-ended questions. The questionnaire was distributed on parents‟ communication platforms. The data indicated that the introduction of technology has caused concern amongst parents. The parents sensed that their children‟s (inter alia) academic goals, neurological development, competency in computer usage and health, are affected by the introduction of technology. They experienced an increase in difficulty to monitor learning; some children find it more difficult to study and that children are easily distracted. The parents managed these interferences by amongst others acquiring hard copy textbooks; adjusting the way they monitor homework and agreeing to trust their children rather than attempting to monitor everything. The findings illustrate the importance of involving parents in the technology implementation process because of their close involvement in the academic development of their children (especially primary school children).},

We complement the extant work by analysing a sample of 449 online toy advertisements targeting children in Brazil, a largely unregulated market. Results show that multinational corporations are more likely to include disclaimers in their online ads than local Brazilian companies. Further analyses reveal, however, that advertising disclaimers used by multinational subsidiaries have more distractors that reduce viewer comprehension. Our research contributes to the ﬁelds of advertising and institutional theory by being the ﬁrst to document whether and how multinational subsidiaries use disclaimers in online ads targeting an unregulated market.},

Restrictive mediation, how it connects to protectionism, and whether restriction serves as a form of media literacy is raised. Lastly, active mediation and whether it relates to an inquiry model of media literacy is discussed. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research on parental mediation and media literacy in the hopes of advancing parent media education.},

	abstract = {Media literacy education in the United States is actively focused on the instructional methods and pedagogy of media literacy, integrating theoretical and critical frameworks rising from constructivist learning theory, media studies and cultural studies scholarship. This work has arisen from a legacy of media and technology use in education throughout the 20th century and the emergence of cross-disciplinary work at the intersections of scholarly work in media studies and education. Reﬂecting the emergence of a common ground for the ﬁeld, the Core Principles of Media Literacy Education in the United States was created by a team of scholars and practitioners in 2007. This work reconciles the “protectionist” and “empowerment” wings of the media literacy education community and attempts to counter various misunderstandings among non-specialists. Two issues are identiﬁed for their potential to impact the future of the ﬁeld: (1) media literacy’s relationship to the integration of educational technology into the K-12 curriculum and (2) the relationship between media literacy education and the humanities, arts, and sciences.},

	abstract = {WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in the world. The closed nature of the app, in addition to the ease of transferring multimedia and sharing information to large-scale groups make WhatsApp unique among other platforms, where an anonymous encrypted messages can become viral, reaching multiple users in a short period of time. The personal feeling and immediacy of messages directly delivered to the user’s phone on WhatsApp was extensively abused to spread unfounded rumors and create misinformation campaigns during recent elections in Brazil and India. WhatsApp has been deploying measures to mitigate this problem, such as reducing the limit for forwarding a message to at most ﬁve users at once. Despite the welcomed eﬀort to counter the problem, there is no evidence so far on the real eﬀectiveness of such restrictions. In this work, we propose a methodology to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of such measures on the spreading of misinformation circulating on WhatsApp. We use an epidemiological model and real data gathered from WhatsApp in Brazil, India and Indonesia to assess the impact of limiting virality features in this kind of network. Our results suggest that the current eﬀorts deployed by WhatsApp can oﬀer signiﬁcant delays on the information spread, but they are ineﬀective in blocking the propagation of misinformation campaigns through public groups when the content has a high viral nature.},

Methods: Information was collected from the general Nigerian population through online Google forms which were majorly disseminated via Facebook and WhatsApp platforms. The data retrieved was analysed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression.
Results: A total of 703 questionnaires were included in the final analysis. The respondents’ mean age was (30.2±6.7) years, predominantly male (73.2\%). Almost all of them (95.0\%) had received some message to use salt water, 37.4\% of whom received such message on social media. Around a half of them ever made an attempt to verify the health information they received on social media (50.9\%), and about a quarter (24.0\%) of them had used salt water during the outbreak. Many of them had used salt water because they believed it would not harm them (52.0\%). Salt water was less likely to be used by those who had received such message on social media, as well as by those who had received some contrary information to salt use.
Conclusions: Social media could serve as an effective tool in propagating health information and should be actively engaged by health agencies, to spread accurate information.},

Currently, there are serious concerns that this platform can become a fertile ground for groups interested in disseminating misinformation, especially as part of articulated political campaigns. Particularly, WhatsApp provides an important space for users to engage in public conversations that worth attention, the public groups. These groups are suitable for political activism and social movement organization. Additionally, it is reasonable to assume that a malicious misinformation campaign might attempt to maximize the audience of a fake story by sharing it in existing public groups. In this paper, we present a system for gathering, analyzing and visualize public groups in WhatsApp. In addition to describe our methodology, we also provide a brief characterization of the content shared in 127 Brazilian groups. We hope our system can help journalists and researchers to understand the repercussion of events related to the Brazilian elections within these groups.},

In this paper, we present a grounded typology to classify links to news sources into different categories including ‘junk’ news sources that deliberately publish or aggregate misleading, deceptive or incorrect information packaged as real news about politics, economics or culture obtained from public WhatsApp groups. Further, we examine a sample of 200 videos and images, extracted from a sample of WhatsApp groups and develop a new typology to classify this media content.

We analyze the types of content shared within such groups as well as the network structures that emerge from user interactions within and cross-groups. We then deepen our analysis by identifying the presence of misinformation among the shared images using labels provided by journalists and by a proposed automatic procedure based on Google searches. We identify the most important sources of the fake images and analyze how they propagate across WhatsApp groups and from/to other Web platforms.},

With a user-friendly interface, it allows people to instantaneously exchange messages in a very intuitive and fluid way. The app also allows people to interact using group chats, sharing messages, videos, audios, and images. These groups can also be a fertile ground to spread rumors and misinformation. In this work, we analyzed the messages shared on a number of political-oriented WhatsApp groups, focusing on textual content, as it is the most shared media type. Our study relied on a dataset containing all textual messages shared in those groups during the 2018 Brazilian presidential campaign. We identified the presence of misinformation in the contents of these messages using a dataset of priorly checked misinformation from six Brazilian fact-checking sites. Our study aims at identifying characteristics that distinguish such messages from the other textual messages (with unchecked content). To that end, we analyzed various properties of the textual content (e.g., language usage, main topics and sentiment of message’s content) and propagation dynamics of both sets of messages. Our analyses revealed that textual messages with misinformation tend to be concentrated on fewer topics, often carrying words related to the cognitive process of insight, which characterizes chain messages. We also found that their propagation process is much more viral with a distinct behavior: they tend to propagate faster within particular groups but take longer to cross group boundaries.},

	abstract = {Influencer marketing has been experiencing a wave of popularity the last years, and predicted to be the marketing strategy of 2017. Since influencer marketing is a relatively new term, it has no academic definition, and a scarce theoretical foundation exists. Earlier research on influencer marketing has mainly focused on identifying influencers and if they are perceived to be credible. To the best of our knowledge there has been no research investigating the relationship between influencer marketing and purchase intention. Therefore, this master thesis sets out to investigate how influencer marketing affects consumers’ purchase intentions based on the theoretical framework Theory of Reasoned Action. By studying how influencer marketing affects the theoretical framework, we combine the fields of marketing strategy with consumer behaviour. In addition, we have examined how influencer marketing measures up against regular online advertisement. A modified experiment was conducted through the means of an online questionnaire distributed through Facebook. The questionnaire generated responses from 180 respondents, and the results show as expected that influencer marketing positively influences consumers’ “attitude towards the behaviour”, and has no effect on consumer “subjective norm” in the Theory of Reasoned Action framework. However, more surprisingly the results show that influencer marketing has no direct effect on consumers purchase intention, and that influencer marketing is not a more efficient marketing strategy than regular online advertisement. Still, we encourage more research into the field of influencer marketing to further examine this result.},

Unsurprisingly, we ﬁnd that the largest cascades tend to be generated by users who have been inﬂuential in the past and who have a large number of followers. We also ﬁnd that URLs that were rated more interesting and/or elicited more positive feelings by workers on Mechanical Turk were more likely to spread. In spite of these intuitive results, however, we ﬁnd that predictions of which particular user or URL will generate large cascades are relatively unreliable. We conclude, therefore, that wordof-mouth diﬀusion can only be harnessed reliably by targeting large numbers of potential inﬂuencers, thereby capturing average eﬀects. Finally, we consider a family of hypothetical marketing strategies, deﬁned by the relative cost of identifying versus compensating potential “inﬂuencers.” We ﬁnd that although under some circumstances, the most inﬂuential users are also the most cost-eﬀective, under a wide range of plausible assumptions the most cost-eﬀective performance can be realized using “ordinary inﬂuencers”—individuals who exert average or even less-than-average inﬂuence.},

	abstract = {Social media treats all users the same: trusted friend or total stranger, with little or nothing in between. In reality, relationships fall everywhere along this spectrum, a topic social science has investigated for decades under the theme of tie strength. Our work bridges this gap between theory and practice. In this paper, we present a predictive model that maps social media data to tie strength. The model builds on a dataset of over 2,000 social media ties and performs quite well, distinguishing between strong and weak ties with over 85\% accuracy. We complement these quantitative findings with interviews that unpack the relationships we could not predict. The paper concludes by illustrating how modeling tie strength can improve social media design elements, including privacy controls, message routing, friend introductions and information prioritization.},

Visibility of national and international priorities such as public health, political unrest, disaster relief, and climate change has increased, yet we know little about the benefits—and possible costs—of engaging in social activism via social media. These powerful social issues introduce a need for scientific research into technology mediated social participation. What are the actual, tangible benefits of “greening” Twitter profile pictures in support of the Iranian elections? Does cartooning a Facebook profile picture really raise awareness of child abuse? Are there unintended negative effects through low-risk, low-cost technology-mediated participation? And, is there a difference—in both outcome and engagement level—between different types of online social activism? This SIG will investigate technology mediated social participation through a critical lens, discussing both the potential positive and negative outcomes of such participation. Approaches to designing for increased participation, evaluating effects of participation, and next steps in scientific research directions will be discussed.},

However research efforts toward characterizing and forecasting this risk is limited due to the paucity of information regarding suicide ideation, exacerbated by the stigma of mental illness. This paper ﬁlls gaps in the literature by developing a statistical methodology to infer which individuals could undergo transitions from mental health discourse to suicidal ideation. We utilize semi-anonymous support communities on Reddit as unobtrusive data sources to infer the likelihood of these shifts. We develop language and interactional measures for this purpose, as well as a propensity score matching based statistical approach. Our approach allows us to derive distinct markers of shifts to suicidal ideation. These markers can be modeled in a prediction framework to identify individuals likely to engage in suicidal ideation in the future. We discuss societal and ethical implications of this research.},

For many parents in the U.S., engagement is still a struggle partly due to a lack of communication and community-building tools that support the broader ecology of parenting, or parental ecology. Although current technologies have the potential to create opportunities to improve parental engagement, little is known about the impact of existing technology’s design on the parental ecology. We present ﬁndings from 63 interviews with parents and an observation of existing technologies that support parent-school interactions. We found four critical issues that the design of current technologies need to address: (1) inﬂexibility in the boundaries of digital spaces, (2) inequality, (3) fragmentation and inconsistency of information, and (4) lack of relevant non-academic information. As a result, we propose design guidelines for technologies to support the parental ecology, and reﬂect on design issues that require further research.},

Increasingly, HCI scholars are proposing assets-based design as an effective approach towards this issue. Rather than starting from people’s needs and deﬁcits, this approach posits that design should start from a deep understanding of people’s assets. A pending issue, however, is how to account for the situated nature of assets; that is, how to decide which asset to leverage and for what design purpose. Drawing from cultural sociology and shifting the emphasis from assets to capacities, we propose Swidler’s theory of culture-in-action as an analytical lens for unpacking the complex relationship between capacities, goals, and structural limitations. Leveraging ﬁndings from a Participatory Design engagement with 35 Latino immigrant parents for envisioning parent-education technologies, we demonstrate the applicability of this lens. We contribute to HCI scholarship by further discussing 1) how to analyze capacities’ design potential, and 2) the methodological particularities for collecting them.},

Whilst the former have trusted the technical orientation of the triad as a unique point of reference in information security, the latter have questioned the triad’s capacity of addressing the breadth of socio-technical issues that have emerged in security since the 2000s. Through a revisiting of the key tenets of the triad, the paper reconciles these two, seemingly fragmented, approaches. The main argument is that the CIA triad will continue to assume a major role in information security practice. However, this is not due to the fact that practitioners have discarded, or rejected the enhancements that socio-technical security scholars have proposed over the years; rather, it is because these enhancements can be accommodated by a broader re-conceptualization of the original CIA triad.

	abstract = {Dark patterns are (evil) design nudges that steer people’s behaviour through persuasive interface design. Increasingly found in cookie consent requests, they possibly undermine principles of EU privacy law. In two preregistered online experiments we investigated the effects of three common design nudges (default, aesthetic manipulation, obstruction) on users’ consent decisions and their perception of control over their personal data in these situations. In the first experiment (N = 228) we explored the effects of design nudges towards the privacy-unfriendly option (dark patterns). The experiment revealed that most participants agreed to all consent requests regardless of dark design nudges. Unexpectedly, despite generally low levels of perceived control, obstructing the privacy-friendly option led to more rather than less perceived control. In the second experiment (N = 255) we reversed the direction of the design nudges towards the privacy-friendly option, which we title “bright patterns”. This time the obstruction and default nudges swayed people effectively towards the privacy-friendly option, while the result regarding perceived control stayed the same compared to Experiment 1. Overall, our findings suggest that many current implementations of cookie consent requests do not enable meaningful choices by internet users, and are thus not in line with the intention of the EU policymakers. We also explore how policymakers could address the problem.},

	abstract = {There is a rapidly growing literature on dark patterns, user interface designs—typically related to shopping or privacy—that researchers deem problematic. Recent work has been predominantly descriptive, documenting and categorizing objectionable user interfaces. These contributions have been invaluable in highlighting specific designs for researchers and policymakers. But the current literature lacks a conceptual foundation: What makes a user interface a dark pattern? Why are certain designs problematic for users or society? We review recent work on dark patterns and demonstrate that the literature does not reflect a singular concern or consistent definition, but rather, a set of thematically related considerations. Drawing from scholarship in psychology, economics, ethics, philosophy, and law, we articulate a set of normative perspectives for analyzing dark patterns and their effects on individuals and society. We then show how future research on dark patterns can go beyond subjective criticism of user interface designs and apply empirical methods grounded in normative perspectives.},

	abstract = {Objective: Young children use mobile devices on average 1 hour/day, but no studies have examined the prevalence of advertising in children’s apps. The objective of this study was to describe the advertising content of popular children’s apps. Methods: To create a coding scheme, we downloaded and played 39 apps played by children aged 12 months to 5 years in a pilot study of a mobile sensing app; 2 researchers played each app, took detailed notes on the design of advertisements, and iteratively refined the codebook (interrater reliability 0.96). Codes were then applied to the 96 most downloaded free and paid apps in the 5 And Under category on the Google Play app store. Results: Of the 135 apps reviewed, 129 (95\%) contained at least 1 type of advertising. These included use of commercial characters (42\%); full-app teasers (46\%); advertising videos interrupting play (e.g., pop-ups [35\%] or to unlock play items [16\%]); in-app purchases (30\%); prompts to rate the app (28\%) or share on social media (14\%); distracting ads such as banners across the screen (17\%) or hidden ads with misleading symbols such as “\$” or camouflaged as gameplay items (7\%). Advertising was significantly more prevalent in free apps (100\% vs 88\% of paid apps), but occurred at similar rates in apps labeled as “educational” versus other categories. Conclusion: In this exploratory study, we found high rates of mobile advertising through manipulative and disruptive methods. These results have implications for advertising regulation, parent media choices, and apps’ educational value.},

In addition, we investigate from a psychological perspective why privacy dark strategies are eﬀective. The resulting framework allows for a better understanding of these dark concepts, fosters awareness, and supports the development of countermeasures.

	abstract = {The rise of interactive intelligent systems has surfaced the need to make system reasoning and decision-making understandable to users through means such as explanation facilities. Apart from bringing significant technical challenges, the call to make such systems explainable, transparent and controllable may conflict with stakeholders’ interests. For example, intelligent algorithms are often an inherent part of business models so that companies might be reluctant to disclose details on their inner workings. In this paper, we argue that as a consequence, this conflict might result in means for explanation, transparency and control that do not necessarily benefit users. Indeed, we even see a risk that the actual virtues of such means might be turned into dark patterns: user interfaces that purposefully deceive users for the benefit of other parties. We present and discuss such possible dark patterns of explainability, transparency and control building on dark UX design patterns by Grey et al. The resulting dark patterns serve as a thought-provoking addition to the greater discussion in this field.},

	abstract = {So-called dark patterns are widely discussed in game design. This phenomenon raises concerns for gaming education because numerous dark patterns trick players into real money transactions or gambling. A major obstacle to the practical assessment of the severity of a ‘dark’ pattern is the very definition of ‘game patterns’, basing solely on action-oriented structures. In order to take into account not only abstract expressions of the game system, but also the experience of the player, as well as the diverse contexts in which games are played, this article proposes to use the semiotic model of the ‘ludeme’. A ludeme is a minimal element in game design consisting of a grapheme, an acousteme, and a motifeme. We begin by explaining and situating the conceptual framework of the ludeme theory, with a specific interest in its application to repetitions of the same game element over time and through different digital games. Then, the theoretical framework is applied to SimCity BuildIt and particularly to the ‘dark patterns’ in it. In the last part, paths for further developments of the model of ludemic analysis are discussed, with regard to its relevance for media education and digital game literacy.},

While previous work has addressed consent banners from either interaction design, legal, and ethics-focused perspectives, little research addresses the connections among multiple disciplinary approaches, including tensions and opportunities that transcend disciplinary boundaries. In this paper, we draw together perspectives and commentary from HCI, design, privacy and data protection, and legal research communities, using the language and strategies of “dark patterns” to perform an interaction criticism reading of three diferent types of consent banners. Our analysis builds upon designer, interface, user, and social context lenses to raise tensions and synergies that arise together in complex, contingent, and conficting ways in the act of designing consent banners. We conclude with opportunities for transdisciplinary dialogue across legal, ethical, computer science, and interactive systems scholarship to translate matters of ethical concern into public policy.},

The number of websites and mobile applications available is growing, but so are various persuasive approaches to influence human behavior and decision-making in online environments. While designing for persuasion has many potential benefits, recent years have revealed different deceptive design techniques that utilize the understanding of psychological principles to nudge people in a desired direction. This thesis outlines and explores this phenomenon known as dark patterns, which favors business goals over user values. Practitioners have laid out many deceiving design strategies in the past, but it remains unclear how the end user perceives and experiences them. Therefore, a qualitative method approach was chosen to study the end users’ perspectives on the subject. The analysis of the data shows that even though there was some awareness, many manipulative techniques were unknown. Participants blame the businesses, remark however to be partly responsible for their own fate. In addition, the acceptability of such techniques shifts depending on the respective dark pattern.},

The second is to identify the underlying factors that make users victims of the different types of dark patterns. The third objective is to identify the difference in the impact on the users, caused by the least identified and the most identified dark pattern. This paper presents five elements that play an important role in the identification of dark patterns by the users, even if they are not completely aware of the unethical intentions behind the design. In addition to that, a taxonomy is formed with the factors that trigger the users towards dark patterns. Strong correlations and associations between these five elements and the user’s ability to identify dark patterns are found. It was also found that the correlations between the elements differ from the type of dark pattern in consideration. This paper helps in understanding the factors that influence the users to become victims of dark patterns and the difference in the impact of the different types of dark patterns on the user. The variables and factors of identification determined in this research can benefit the HCI community to understand the adverse effects of dark patterns on usability.},

We found that dark patterns and implied consent are ubiquitous; only 11.8\% meet our minimal requirements based on European law. Second, we conducted a field experiment with 40 participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent choices. We found that notification style (banner or barrier) has no effect; removing the opt-out button from the first page increases consent by 22–23 percentage points; and providing more granular controls on the first page decreases consent by 8–20 percentage points. This study provides an empirical basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the GDPR, in particular the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party CMP services as an effective way to increase compliance.},

While interest in proxemic interactions has increased over the last few years, it also has a dark side: knowledge of proxemics may (and likely will) be easily exploited to the detriment of the user. In this paper, we offer a critical perspective on proxemic interactions in the form of dark patterns: ways proxemic interactions can be misused.

            Nudging is simply guiding people behaviors by the use of user-interface and design elements in digital environments. Today, many decisions are made in online environments. Gaining insights about digital nudging can greatly help communicators, policy makers, and designers lead users to make the most desirable choice for them and/or for the wealth of the society as well. Digital nudges can be used in many digital environments like e-mail, SMS, push notifications, mobile apps, social media, gamification, e-commerce, e-government, location services, corporate digital information systems, and many other digital interfaces that include any kind of decision-making processes. This study is a descriptive study and more of a qualitative nature and aims to identify the digital nudging concept, dark patterns, and usage of digital nudges in real-life applications. It also proposes a brief digital nudging process schema to be used for designing behavioral digital interventions.},

While that sounds attractive and many rush implementing novel ideas things such as gamiﬁcation, a serious professional and scientiﬁcally rich discussion is needed to portray a holistic picture on technology inﬂuence. Relatively little research has been aimed at exploring the negative aspects, outcomes, and side eﬀects of PT. Therefore this research aims at addressing this gap by reviewing the existing knowledge on dark patterns, demonstrating how intended Pt designs can be critically examined, introducing the Visibility-Darkness matrix to categorize and locate dark patterns, and proposing a Framework for Evaluating the Darkness of Persuasive Technology (FEDPT). The framework is instrumental for designers and developers of inﬂuential technology, as it clariﬁes an area where their products and services can have a negative impact on well-being, in other words, can become harmful to the users.},

	abstract = {Manipulation defines many of our experiences as a consumer, including subtle nudges and overt advertising campaigns that seek to gain our attention and money. With the advent of digital services that can continuously optimize online experiences to favor stakeholder requirements, increasingly designers and developers make use of "dark patterns"---forms of manipulation that prey on human psychology---to encourage certain behaviors and discourage others in ways that present unequal value to the end user. In this paper, we provide an account of end user perceptions of manipulation that builds on and extends notions of dark patterns. We report on the results of a survey of users conducted in English and Mandarin Chinese (n=169), including follow-up interviews from nine survey respondents. We used a card sorting method to support thematic analysis of responses from each cultural context, identifying both qualitatively-supported insights to describe end users' felt experiences of manipulative products, and a continuum of manipulation. We further support this analysis through a quantitative analysis of survey results and the presentation of vignettes from the interviews. We conclude with implications for future research, considerations for public policy, and guidance on how to further empower and give users autonomy in their experiences with digital services.},

This genre of contract is afforded its ‘standard form’ so as to increase the efficiency of transactions and save costs, which are ostensibly passed on to consumers. Since one party is generally less powerful in terms of access to information and resources, however, these contracts are often acknowledged as imbalanced and have been of concern for consumer rights in recent years. While some have characterized these issues as a ‘duty to read’ for consumers or as egregious terms and weak disclosures by drafters,’ this project suggests at least part of the issues exist from a lack of consideration of the document itself (i.e., medium, format, authenticity, reliability, stability) and the processes that deem it ‘standard.’ It makes use of the disciplines that specialise in these topics, including document theory, library and information science, diplomatics, standards of records management, textual criticism and bibliography, and evidence to offer a revised perspective on SFCC issues and a new measure of assessment. Ultimately, it concludes that current governance is not adequate to address the issues of these agreements and suggests three principles, or shifts in concept: 1) standardisation, not standard practise; 2) explanation, not notification; and 3) documentation, not integration.},

            Dark patterns are user interfaces whose designers knowingly confuse users, make it difficult for users to express their actual preferences, or manipulate users into taking certain actions. They typically exploit cognitive biases and prompt online consumers to purchase goods and services that they do not want or to reveal personal information they would prefer not to disclose. This article provides the first public evidence of the power of dark patterns. It discusses the results of the authors’ two large-scale experiments in which representative samples of American consumers were exposed to dark patterns. In the first study, users exposed to mild dark patterns were more than twice as likely to sign up for a dubious service as those assigned to the control group, and users in the aggressive dark pattern condition were almost four times as likely to subscribe. Moreover, whereas aggressive dark patterns generated a powerful backlash among consumers, mild dark patterns did not. Less educated subjects were significantly more susceptible to mild dark patterns than their well-educated counterparts. The second study identified the dark patterns that seem most likely to nudge consumers into making decisions that they are likely to regret or misunderstand. Hidden information, trick question, and obstruction strategies were particularly likely to manipulate consumers successfully. Other strategies employing loaded language or generating bandwagon effects worked moderately well, while still others such as “must act now” messages did not make consumers more likely to purchase a costly service. Our second study also replicated a striking result in the first experiment, which is that where dark patterns were employed the cost of the service offered to consumers became immaterial. Decision architecture, not price, drove consumer purchasing decisions. The article concludes by examining legal frameworks for addressing dark patterns. Many dark patterns appear to violate federal and state laws restricting the use of unfair and deceptive practices in trade. Moreover, in those instances where consumers enter into contracts after being exposed to dark patterns, their consent could be deemed voidable under contract law principles. The article also proposes that dark pattern audits become part of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)’s consent decree process. Dark patterns are presumably proliferating because firms’ proprietary A-B testing has revealed them to be profit maximizing. We show how similar A-B testing can be used to identify those dark patterns that are so manipulative that they ought to be deemed unlawful.},

Although designing for persuasion offers several potential benefits, recent developments expose various deceptive designs, that is, dark patterns, that utilize psychological factors to nudge people toward, from someone else’s perspective, desired directions. This paper contributes to an increased awareness of the phenomenon of dark patterns through our exploring how users perceive and experience these patterns. Hence, we chose a qualitative research approach, with focus groups and interviews, for our exploration. Our analysis shows that participants were moderately aware of these deceptive techniques, several of which were perceived as sneaky and dishonest. Respondents further expressed a resigned attitude toward such techniques and primarily blamed businesses for their occurrence. Users considered their dependency on services employing these practices, thus making it difficult to avoid fully dark patterns.},

We describe a set of five performative practices our participants employed to maintain individuality and privacy, despite frequent borrowing and monitoring of their devices by family and social relations. These practices involved management of phone and app locks, content deletion, technology avoidance, and use of private modes. We present design opportunities for maintaining privacy on shared devices that are mindful of the social norms and values in the South Asian countries studied, including to improve discovery of privacy controls, offer content hiding, and provide algorithmic understanding of multiple-user use cases.

	abstract = {Given the diffusion of the Social Web and increased disclosure of personal information online, the ‘privacy paradox’ suggests that while Internet users are concerned about privacy, their behaviors do not mirror those concerns. This study investigates the potential inﬂuence of privacy concerns, psychological traits, attitudes to the Social Web and age on self-disclosure. Using an online survey of a representative sample of German Internet users (n = 2, 739), the variety and quality of self-disclosure as well as access were measured. The ﬁndings indicate that privacy concerns hardly impact self-disclosure, but different variables moderate this relation. Perceived social relevance and the number of applications used proved important. Users’ general willingness to disclose is most important when providing sensitive information.},

Although voice forums have received impassioned usage from low-income, low-literate, rural, tribal, and disabled communities in diverse HCI4D contexts, the participation of women in these services is almost non-existent. In this paper, we investigate the reasons for the low participation of women in social media voice forums by examining the use of Sangeet Swara in India and Baang in Pakistan by marginalized women and men. Our mixed-methods approach spanning content analysis of audio posts, quantitative analysis of interactions between users, and qualitative interviews with users indicate gender inequity due to deep-rooted patriarchal values. We found that women on these forums faced systemic discrimination and encountered abusive content, flirts, threats, and harassment. We discuss design recommendations to create social media voice forums that foster gender equity in use of these services.},

Second, users displayed general knowledge gaps on existing social media privacy settings and relied heavily on blocking and passwords for privacy and security protection. Third, users’ privacy and security-related behaviors were heavily inﬂuenced by living in high-crime areas.

By surveying 406 individuals, we found that they are generally aware of the influence that manipulative designs can exert on their online behaviour. However, being aware does not equip users with the ability to oppose such influence. We further find that respondents, especially younger ones, often recognise the "darkness" of certain designs, but remain unsure of the actual harm they may suffer.

We assembled a corpus of examples of practitioner-identiﬁed dark patterns and performed a content analysis to determine the ethical concerns contained in these examples. This analysis revealed a wide range of ethical issues raised by practitioners that were frequently conﬂated under the umbrella term of dark patterns, while also underscoring a shared concern that UX designers could easily become complicit in manipulative or unreasonably persuasive practices. We conclude with implications for the education and practice of UX designers, and a proposal for broadening research on the ethics of user experience.},

To court larger player audiences and to address their wide willingness-topay spectrum, game developers have increasingly adopted the free-to-play revenue model. However, at the same time, worrying concerns over the revenue model have been voiced, deeming it as exploitative and unethical. We investigated this contrast by conducting an interview study. We employed thematic qualitative text analysis process with the data containing 14 interviews with game professionals about their views on the model. The results show that the free-to-play model is something that developers view favorably while it was felt that the public writing about the games can be negative, even hostile. Relatively few ethical problems were seen that would address the whole model while for instance the combination of children and free-to-play was seen as problematic. Even with some concerns at the moment, the future of the free-to-play games was seen bright.},

Building upon earlier work in design patterns, we call these abstracted elements Dark Game Design Patterns. In this paper, we develop the concept of dark design patterns in games, present examples of such patterns, explore some of the subtleties involved in identifying them, and provide questions that can be asked to help guide in the specification and identification of future Dark Patterns.

We highlight how ageing is typically defined through an emphasis on the economic and societal impact of health and care needs of older people, concerns around socialisation as people age, and declines in abilities and associated reductions in performance when using technology. We draw from research within the fields of social and critical gerontology to highlight how these discourses in SIGCHI literature represent common stereotypes around old age that have also prevailed in the wider literature in gerontology.

Hence, these voice assistants offer new opportunities to different populations, including individuals who are not interested or able to use traditional computing devices such as computers and smartphones. To understand how older adults who use technology infrequently perceive and use these voice assistants, we conducted a 3-week field deployment of the Amazon Echo Dot in the homes of seven older adults. While some types of usage dropped over the 3-week period (e.g., playing music), we observed consistent usage for finding online information. Given that much of this information was health-related, this finding emphasizes the need to revisit concerns about credibility of information with this new interaction medium. Although features to support memory (e.g., setting timers, reminders) were initially perceived as useful, the actual usage was unexpectedly low due to reliability concerns. We discuss how these findings apply to other user groups along with design implications and recommendations for future work on voice-user interfaces.},

WhatsApp has been deploying measures to mitigate this problem, such as reducing the limit for forwarding a message to at most ﬁve users at once. Despite the welcomed eﬀort to counter the problem, there is no evidence so far on the real eﬀectiveness of such restrictions. In this work, we propose a methodology to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of such measures on the spreading of misinformation circulating on WhatsApp. We use an epidemiological model and real data gathered from WhatsApp in Brazil, India and Indonesia to assess the impact of limiting virality features in this kind of network. Our results suggest that the current eﬀorts deployed by WhatsApp can oﬀer signiﬁcant delays on the information spread, but they are ineﬀective in blocking the propagation of misinformation campaigns through public groups when the content has a high viral nature.},

This study, carried out in Bahrain, evaluated the truthfulness of 22 social media claims about drugs (72.7\%), dietary supplements (22.7\%), and toxic bisphenol-A (4.5\%). They circulated on WhatsApp platform, as case studies. We categorized claims as objectively true, false, or potentially misleading. The content analysis revealed that “potentially misleading” claims were the most frequent messages (59.1\%). They tend to exaggerate the efficacy or safety without sufficient evidence to substantiate claims. False claims (27.3\%) were likely due to unfair competition or deception. Overall, 13.6\% of the messages were objectively true claims that could withstand regulatory scrutiny. Majority of the drugrelated messages on social media were potentially misleading or false claims that lacked credible evidence to support them. In the public interest, regulatory authorities should monitor such information disseminated via social media platforms.},

Methods: Information was collected from the general Nigerian population through online Google forms which were majorly disseminated via Facebook and WhatsApp platforms. The data retrieved was analysed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression.
Results: A total of 703 questionnaires were included in the final analysis. The respondents’ mean age was (30.2±6.7) years, predominantly male (73.2\%). Almost all of them (95.0\%) had received some message to use salt water, 37.4\% of whom received such message on social media. Around a half of them ever made an attempt to verify the health information they received on social media (50.9\%), and about a quarter (24.0\%) of them had used salt water during the outbreak. Many of them had used salt water because they believed it would not harm them (52.0\%). Salt water was less likely to be used by those who had received such message on social media, as well as by those who had received some contrary information to salt use.
Conclusions: Social media could serve as an effective tool in propagating health information and should be actively engaged by health agencies, to spread accurate information.},

Currently, there are serious concerns that this platform can become a fertile ground for groups interested in disseminating misinformation, especially as part of articulated political campaigns. Particularly, WhatsApp provides an important space for users to engage in public conversations that worth attention, the public groups. These groups are suitable for political activism and social movement organization. Additionally, it is reasonable to assume that a malicious misinformation campaign might attempt to maximize the audience of a fake story by sharing it in existing public groups. In this paper, we present a system for gathering, analyzing and visualize public groups in WhatsApp. In addition to describe our methodology, we also provide a brief characterization of the content shared in 127 Brazilian groups. We hope our system can help journalists and researchers to understand the repercussion of events related to the Brazilian elections within these groups.},

In this paper, we present a grounded typology to classify links to news sources into different categories including ‘junk’ news sources that deliberately publish or aggregate misleading, deceptive or incorrect information packaged as real news about politics, economics or culture obtained from public WhatsApp groups. Further, we examine a sample of 200 videos and images, extracted from a sample of WhatsApp groups and develop a new typology to classify this media content.

In particular, in events of great social mobilization, such as strikes and electoral campaigns, WhatsApp group chats are very attractive as they facilitate information exchange among interested people. Yet, recent events have raised concerns about the spreading of misinformation in WhatsApp. In this work, we analyze information dissemination within WhatsApp, focusing on publicly accessible political-oriented groups, collecting all shared messages during major social events in Brazil: a national truck drivers’ strike and the Brazilian presidential campaign. We analyze the types of content shared within such groups as well as the network structures that emerge from user interactions within and cross-groups. We then deepen our analysis by identifying the presence of misinformation among the shared images using labels provided by journalists and by a proposed automatic procedure based on Google searches. We identify the most important sources of the fake images and analyze how they propagate across WhatsApp groups and from/to other Web platforms.},

Our tool monitors multiple content categories such as images, videos, audio, and textual messages posted on a set of WhatsApp groups and displays the most shared content per day. Our tool has been used for monitoring content during the 2018 Brazilian general election and was one of the major sources for estimating the spread of misinformation and helping fact-checking efforts.},

Such use by political parties comes with numerous challenges, including the danger of the platform being “weaponized” and used for spreading misinformation and polarizing content. In this paper, we propose to analyze and characterize image based misinformation being shared on political WhatsApp groups. We identify misinformation by cross referencing images shared on WhatsApp with a large database of fact checked images. Using these images, we try to create a typology of various types of visual misinformation, and understand how visual information is used as a tool of deceit. We also study the spread of such misinformation across other social media platforms and understand the role that WhatsApp plays in such spread. We finally detail the challenges in solving the problem of image based misinformation and the tools and advances required to address the issue.},

The app also allows people to interact using group chats, sharing messages, videos, audios, and images. These groups can also be a fertile ground to spread rumors and misinformation. In this work, we analyzed the messages shared on a number of political-oriented WhatsApp groups, focusing on textual content, as it is the most shared media type. Our study relied on a dataset containing all textual messages shared in those groups during the 2018 Brazilian presidential campaign. We identified the presence of misinformation in the contents of these messages using a dataset of priorly checked misinformation from six Brazilian fact-checking sites. Our study aims at identifying characteristics that distinguish such messages from the other textual messages (with unchecked content). To that end, we analyzed various properties of the textual content (e.g., language usage, main topics and sentiment of message’s content) and propagation dynamics of both sets of messages. Our analyses revealed that textual messages with misinformation tend to be concentrated on fewer topics, often carrying words related to the cognitive process of insight, which characterizes chain messages. We also found that their propagation process is much more viral with a distinct behavior: they tend to propagate faster within particular groups but take longer to cross group boundaries.},

Despite anonymization, data reporting and sharing may lead to re-identifcation of participants, which can be particularly problematic when the research deals with sensitive topics, such as health. We analyzed 509 CHI papers in the domains of health, wellness, accessibility, and aging to examine data reporting and sharing practices. Our analysis revealed notable patterns and trends regarding the reporting of age, gender, participant types, sample sizes, methodology, ethical considerations, anonymization techniques, and data sharing.

How do users manage these tensions between health, stigma, and privacy? We analysed our interview data using signalling theory as a conceptual framework and identify participants developing ‘signal appropriation’ strategies, helping them manage the disclosure of their HIV status.

BRUBAKER, University of Colorado Boulder, USA CASEY FIESLER, University of Colorado Boulder, USA BRYAN SEMAAN, Syracuse University, USA Online communities provide support for those who are vulnerable, such as LGBTQ people while coming out. Research shows that social support and personal narrative construction are important when recovering from personal crises and traumatic events. As an online community focused on writing fanfiction and also consisting of a large number of LGBTQ members, transformative fandom provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between support, crisis, and narrative. Through an interview study with 31 LGBTQ fanfiction authors, our findings mirror Herman’s model of trauma recovery: these spaces self-organize to support recovery work through constructing "community narratives" that help LGBTQ people establish safety when exploring their identity and build LGBTQ support structures without publicly outing themselves before they are ready, challenge stereotypes, and support others through reshaping existing media that perpetuate inaccurate or harmful LGBTQ narratives. These online communities embody "selective visibility"–that is, though not specifically designed as support structures for identity work and recovery, their design allows people to selectively find and create communities of support for stigmatized issues that they might be unable to safely seek out in other spaces. Based on lessons learned, we generate insights that can inform the design of safe support spaces online.

In collaboration with elders in living facilities, we designed the Memory Music Box; a low-threshold platform to increase connectedness. The HCI community has contributed notable research in support of elders through monitoring, tracking and memory augmentation. Despite the Information and Communication Technologies ﬁeld (ICT) advances in providing new opportunities for connection, challenges in accessibility increase the gap between elders and their loved ones. We approach this challenge by embedding a familiar form factor with innovative applications, performing design evaluations with our key target group to incorporate multi-iteration learnings. These ﬁndings culminate in a novel design that facilitates elders in crossing technology and communication barriers. Based on these ﬁndings, we discuss how future inclusive technologies for the older adults’ can balance ease of use, subtlety and elements of Cognitively Sustainable Design.},

Principles for humanAI interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades, but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI technologies in human-facing applications. We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies, and to researchers interested in the further development of guidelines for human-AI interaction design.},

In this paper, we examine how deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people think about and relate to sounds in the home, solicit feedback and reactions to initial domestic sound awareness systems, and explore potential concerns. We present findings from two qualitative studies: in Study 1, 12 DHH participants discussed their perceptions of and experiences with sound in the home and provided feedback on initial sound awareness mockups. Informed by Study 1, we designed three tablet-based sound awareness prototypes, which we evaluated with 10 DHH participants using a Wizard-of-Oz approach. Together, our findings suggest a general interest in smarthome-based sound awareness systems particularly for displaying contextually aware, personalized and glanceable visualizations but key concerns arose related to privacy, activity tracking, cognitive overload, and trust.},

However, in HCI, research on online shopping for them has only been limited to the analysis of accessibility and usability issues. To develop a broader and better understanding of how visually impaired people shop online and design accordingly, we conducted a qualitative study with twenty blind people. Our study highlighted that blind people’s desire of being treated as ordinary had signifcantly shaped their online shopping practices: very attentive to the visual appearance of the goods even they themselves could not see and taking great pain to fnd and learn what commodities are visually appropriate for them. This paper reports how their trying to appear ordinary is manifested in online shopping and suggests design implications to support these practices.},

We found that online grocery delivery services (a) serve as a feasible model to healthy-food access if they are afordable and amenable to multiple payment forms and (b) could lead to healthier selections. We contribute policy recommendations to bolster afordability of healthy-food access and design opportunities to promote healthy foods to support the adoption and use of these services among low-resource and transportation-scarce groups.},

In collaboration with elders in living facilities, we designed the Memory Music Box; a low-threshold platform to increase connectedness. The HCI community has contributed notable research in support of elders through monitoring, tracking and memory augmentation. Despite the Information and Communication Technologies ﬁeld (ICT) advances in providing new opportunities for connection, challenges in accessibility increase the gap between elders and their loved ones. We approach this challenge by embedding a familiar form factor with innovative applications, performing design evaluations with our key target group to incorporate multi-iteration learnings. These ﬁndings culminate in a novel design that facilitates elders in crossing technology and communication barriers. Based on these ﬁndings, we discuss how future inclusive technologies for the older adults’ can balance ease of use, subtlety and elements of Cognitively Sustainable Design.},

Through semi-structured interviews of parent-child dyads, we explore the perceived privacy and security threats faced by children aged seven to eleven along with the protection mechanisms employed. We identiﬁed four models of privacy held by children. Furthermore, we found that children’s concerns ﬁt into four child-adversary threat models: child-peers, child-media, childstrangers, and child-parents. Their concerns differed from the ﬁve threat models held by the parents: child-peers, childmedia, child-strangers, child-technology, and child-self. Parents used a variety of protection strategies to minimize children’s exposure to external threats. In reality, however, our results suggest that security and privacy risks from an internal family member or a friend are far more common than harm from outsiders.},

We then present Turkopticon, an activist system that allows workers to publicize and evaluate their relationships with employers.

From these two platforms, we collect 13,500 worker proﬁles and gather information about workers’ gender, race, customer reviews, ratings, and positions in search rankings. In both marketplaces, we ﬁnd evidence of bias: we ﬁnd that perceived gender and race are signiﬁcantly correlated with worker evaluations, which could harm the employment opportunities aﬀorded to the workers.

We found that a majority of our participants regularly contended with online abuse, experiencing three major abuse types: cyberstalking, impersonation, and personal content leakages. Consequences of abuse included emotional harm, reputation damage, and physical and sexual violence. Participants coped through informal channels rather than through technological protections or law enforcement. Altogether, our findings point to opportunities for designs, policies, and algorithms to improve women’s safety online in South Asia.},

While most participants were highly interested in being aware of sounds, this interest was modulated by communication preference–that is, for sign or oral communication or both. Almost all participants wanted both visual and haptic feedback and 75\% preferred to have that feedback on separate devices (e.g., haptic on smartwatch, visual on head-mounted display). Other findings related to sound type, full captions vs. keywords, sound filtering, notification styles, and social context provide direct guidance for the design of future mobile and wearable sound awareness systems.},

To help fill this gap, we investigated whether the GenderMag bias detection method can lead directly to designs with fewer gender biases. In our 3-step investigation, two HCI researchers analyzed an industrial software product using GenderMag; we derived design changes to the product using the biases they found; and ran an empirical study of participants using the original product versus the new version. The results showed that using the method in this way did improve the software’s inclusiveness: women succeeded more often in the new version than in the original; men’s success rates improved too; and the gender gap entirely disappeared.},

Using this model, a person creates a ‘shared’ account that contains data they are willing to share and that is assigned a password that will be shared. Simultaneously, they create a separate ‘secret’ account that contains data they prefer to keep secret and that uses a password they do not share with anyone. When a friend or family member asks to check their device, the user can tell them the password for their shared account, with their private data secure in the secret account that the other person is unaware of. We explore the benefits and trade-offs of our design through a three-week deployment with 21 participants in Bangladesh, presenting findings that show how our work aids digital privacy while also highlighting the challenges that remain.},

We found that post-play significantly reduced children’s autonomy and likelihood of self-regulation, extended video-viewing time, and led to increases in parent intervention. We found that the lock-out mechanism did not reduce videoviewing time or the likelihood of parent intervention. Together, our results suggest that avoiding platforms that work to undermine the user’s intentions is more likely to help children self-regulate their media use than rigid parental controls.},

However, it is unclear what types of resources can be acquired and how technology could support these efforts. We address this gap by investigating these questions in the domain of real-time ridesharing systems. We present insights from two qualitative studies: (1) a set of semi-structured interviews with 13 Uber drivers and (2) a set of semi-structured interviews with 13 Uber riders. Our results show that both drivers and riders acquired and beneﬁted from informational, emotional and instrumental resources, as well as cultural exchanges via interactions with each other and with online platforms. We argue that these interactions could support the development of social and cultural capital. We discuss our ﬁndings in the context of labor and contribute design implications for in-car social and cultural experiences and for the ways technologies such as GPS and location-based services can support the additional emotional, social, and cultural labor that drivers provide to their riders.},

Yet, we know little about how design workshops as a research site can engage underserved individuals (i.e., due to class, race, or age status) or address personal concerns (e.g., health). As a way of exploring these issues, we conducted a series of five design workshops with low-income African-American older adults to understand their health experiences. Our findings reveal three insights associated with the design workshop and the topic of health: comfort with community versus personal health; the sociocultural configuration of interaction; and empowerment in the context of systematic inequality of opportunity. We discuss the importance of understanding the situated nature of design workshops, particularly when engaging underserved groups in the topic of health, and the potential of the design workshop as a mechanism for activism.},

Our findings suggest that support needs and structures of mothers evolve during transition, and that they also vary by socio-economic contexts. In this paper, we detail our study design and findings. Informed by our findings, we posit that all life-transitions are not the same, and that therefore, the optimal support intervention point varies for different life transitions. Currently there are no tools available to identify optimal support intervention points during life transitions. To this end, we also introduce a preliminary framework the Strength-Stress-Analysis (SSA) framework - to identify optimal support intervention points during life-transitions.},

In this paper, we designed a follow-up study of online ED characterizations, extending our previous methodologies to focus specifically on male/masculine-related content. We highlight the similarities and differences found in the terminology utilized and media archetypes associated with the social media content. Finally, we discuss other considerations highlighted through our analysis of the male-related content that is missing from the previous research.},

The design followed a two-year ethnography, from which the need for highlighting participation and supporting agency for residents within the care home became clear. The residents use of Printer Pals mediated participation in a number of different ways, such as engaging with the technology itself, offering shared experiences and participating in co-constructive and meaningful ways, each of which is discussed.

We present a cross-platform analysis of how platforms varied in their suitability to achieve participants’ goals, as well as the challenges posed by each platform. We also found that as participants’ ICIs progressed, their goals, challenges, and social media use similarly evolved over time. Our findings highlight how people with ICIs select platforms from a broader ecology of social media and suggest a general need to understand shifts in social media use for populations with chronic but changing health concerns.},

This paper examines the role of game and instructional design during and after breakdowns. We observed 26 young children playing several popular learning games and conducted a moment-by-moment analysis of breakdown episodes. Our findings show children achieve productive breakthroughs independently less than half of the time. In particular, breakdowns caused by game actions are difficult for children to overcome independently and prevent engagement with the domain skills. Importantly, we identify specific instructional game components and their role in fostering strategies that result in successful breakthroughs. We conclude with intrinsic and extrinsic instructional design implications for both game designers and primary teachers to better enable children’s games-based learning.},

	abstract = {When studying technologies pertaining to health, wellness, accessibility, and aging, researchers are often required to perform a balancing act between controlling and sharing sensitive data of the people in their studies and protecting the privacy of these participants. If the data can be anonymized and shared, it can boost the impact of the research by facilitating replication and extension. Despite anonymization, data reporting and sharing may lead to re-identifcation of participants, which can be particularly problematic when the research deals with sensitive topics, such as health. We analyzed 509 CHI papers in the domains of health, wellness, accessibility, and aging to examine data reporting and sharing practices. Our analysis revealed notable patterns and trends regarding the reporting of age, gender, participant types, sample sizes, methodology, ethical considerations, anonymization techniques, and data sharing. Based on our fndings, we propose several suggestions for community standards and practices that could facilitate data reporting and sharing while limiting the privacy risks for study participants.},

	abstract = {HIV status disclosure fields in online sex-social applications ("apps") are designed to help increase awareness, reduce stigma, and promote sexual health. Public disclosure could also help those diagnosed relate to others with similar statuses to feel less isolated. However, in our interview study (n=28) with HIV positive and negative men who have sex with men (MSM), we found some users preferred to keep their status private, especially when disclosure could stigmatise and disadvantage them, or risk revealing their status to someone they knew offline in a different context. How do users manage these tensions between health, stigma, and privacy? We analysed our interview data using signalling theory as a conceptual framework and identify participants developing ‘signal appropriation’ strategies, helping them manage the disclosure of their HIV status. Additionally, we propose a set of design considerations that explore the use of signals in the design of sensitive disclosure fields.},

BRUBAKER, University of Colorado Boulder, USA CASEY FIESLER, University of Colorado Boulder, USA BRYAN SEMAAN, Syracuse University, USA Online communities provide support for those who are vulnerable, such as LGBTQ people while coming out. Research shows that social support and personal narrative construction are important when recovering from personal crises and traumatic events. As an online community focused on writing fanfiction and also consisting of a large number of LGBTQ members, transformative fandom provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between support, crisis, and narrative. Through an interview study with 31 LGBTQ fanfiction authors, our findings mirror Herman’s model of trauma recovery: these spaces self-organize to support recovery work through constructing "community narratives" that help LGBTQ people establish safety when exploring their identity and build LGBTQ support structures without publicly outing themselves before they are ready, challenge stereotypes, and support others through reshaping existing media that perpetuate inaccurate or harmful LGBTQ narratives. These online communities embody "selective visibility"–that is, though not specifically designed as support structures for identity work and recovery, their design allows people to selectively find and create communities of support for stigmatized issues that they might be unable to safely seek out in other spaces. Based on lessons learned, we generate insights that can inform the design of safe support spaces online.

The HCI community has contributed notable research in support of elders through monitoring, tracking and memory augmentation. Despite the Information and Communication Technologies ﬁeld (ICT) advances in providing new opportunities for connection, challenges in accessibility increase the gap between elders and their loved ones. We approach this challenge by embedding a familiar form factor with innovative applications, performing design evaluations with our key target group to incorporate multi-iteration learnings. These ﬁndings culminate in a novel design that facilitates elders in crossing technology and communication barriers. Based on these ﬁndings, we discuss how future inclusive technologies for the older adults’ can balance ease of use, subtlety and elements of Cognitively Sustainable Design.},

Principles for humanAI interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades, but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI technologies in human-facing applications. We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies, and to researchers interested in the further development of guidelines for human-AI interaction design.},

We present findings from two qualitative studies: in Study 1, 12 DHH participants discussed their perceptions of and experiences with sound in the home and provided feedback on initial sound awareness mockups. Informed by Study 1, we designed three tablet-based sound awareness prototypes, which we evaluated with 10 DHH participants using a Wizard-of-Oz approach. Together, our findings suggest a general interest in smarthome-based sound awareness systems particularly for displaying contextually aware, personalized and glanceable visualizations but key concerns arose related to privacy, activity tracking, cognitive overload, and trust.},

The HCI community has contributed notable research in support of elders through monitoring, tracking and memory augmentation. Despite the Information and Communication Technologies ﬁeld (ICT) advances in providing new opportunities for connection, challenges in accessibility increase the gap between elders and their loved ones. We approach this challenge by embedding a familiar form factor with innovative applications, performing design evaluations with our key target group to incorporate multi-iteration learnings. These ﬁndings culminate in a novel design that facilitates elders in crossing technology and communication barriers. Based on these ﬁndings, we discuss how future inclusive technologies for the older adults’ can balance ease of use, subtlety and elements of Cognitively Sustainable Design.},

We identiﬁed four models of privacy held by children. Furthermore, we found that children’s concerns ﬁt into four child-adversary threat models: child-peers, child-media, childstrangers, and child-parents. Their concerns differed from the ﬁve threat models held by the parents: child-peers, childmedia, child-strangers, child-technology, and child-self. Parents used a variety of protection strategies to minimize children’s exposure to external threats. In reality, however, our results suggest that security and privacy risks from an internal family member or a friend are far more common than harm from outsiders.},

We argue that human computation currently relies on worker invisibility. We then present Turkopticon, an activist system that allows workers to publicize and evaluate their relationships with employers. As a common infrastructure, Turkopticon also enables workers to engage one another in mutual aid. We conclude by discussing the potentials and challenges of sustaining activist technologies that intervene in large, existing socio-technical systems.},

From these two platforms, we collect 13,500 worker proﬁles and gather information about workers’ gender, race, customer reviews, ratings, and positions in search rankings. In both marketplaces, we ﬁnd evidence of bias: we ﬁnd that perceived gender and race are signiﬁcantly correlated with worker evaluations, which could harm the employment opportunities aﬀorded to the workers. We hope that our study fuels more research on the presence and implications of discrimination in online environments.},

We found that a majority of our participants regularly contended with online abuse, experiencing three major abuse types: cyberstalking, impersonation, and personal content leakages. Consequences of abuse included emotional harm, reputation damage, and physical and sexual violence. Participants coped through informal channels rather than through technological protections or law enforcement. Altogether, our findings point to opportunities for designs, policies, and algorithms to improve women’s safety online in South Asia.},

While most participants were highly interested in being aware of sounds, this interest was modulated by communication preference–that is, for sign or oral communication or both. Almost all participants wanted both visual and haptic feedback and 75\% preferred to have that feedback on separate devices (e.g., haptic on smartwatch, visual on head-mounted display). Other findings related to sound type, full captions vs. keywords, sound filtering, notification styles, and social context provide direct guidance for the design of future mobile and wearable sound awareness systems.},

In our 3-step investigation, two HCI researchers analyzed an industrial software product using GenderMag; we derived design changes to the product using the biases they found; and ran an empirical study of participants using the original product versus the new version. The results showed that using the method in this way did improve the software’s inclusiveness: women succeeded more often in the new version than in the original; men’s success rates improved too; and the gender gap entirely disappeared.},

	abstract = {People in South Asia frequently share a single device among multiple individuals, resulting in digital privacy challenges. This paper explores a design concept that aims to mitigate some of these challenges through a ‘tiered’ privacy model. Using this model, a person creates a ‘shared’ account that contains data they are willing to share and that is assigned a password that will be shared. Simultaneously, they create a separate ‘secret’ account that contains data they prefer to keep secret and that uses a password they do not share with anyone. When a friend or family member asks to check their device, the user can tell them the password for their shared account, with their private data secure in the secret account that the other person is unaware of. We explore the benefits and trade-offs of our design through a three-week deployment with 21 participants in Bangladesh, presenting findings that show how our work aids digital privacy while also highlighting the challenges that remain.},

We report results from a three-week experimental deployment in 24 homes in which preschoolers used three different versions of the platform: one that is neutral to the limits they set, one that enforces the limits they set, and one that attempts to erode the limits they set by automatically playing additional content after the planned content is finished (“post-play”). We found that post-play significantly reduced children’s autonomy and likelihood of self-regulation, extended video-viewing time, and led to increases in parent intervention. We found that the lock-out mechanism did not reduce videoviewing time or the likelihood of parent intervention. Together, our results suggest that avoiding platforms that work to undermine the user’s intentions is more likely to help children self-regulate their media use than rigid parental controls.},

We address this gap by investigating these questions in the domain of real-time ridesharing systems. We present insights from two qualitative studies: (1) a set of semi-structured interviews with 13 Uber drivers and (2) a set of semi-structured interviews with 13 Uber riders. Our results show that both drivers and riders acquired and beneﬁted from informational, emotional and instrumental resources, as well as cultural exchanges via interactions with each other and with online platforms. We argue that these interactions could support the development of social and cultural capital. We discuss our ﬁndings in the context of labor and contribute design implications for in-car social and cultural experiences and for the ways technologies such as GPS and location-based services can support the additional emotional, social, and cultural labor that drivers provide to their riders.},

Yet, we know little about how design workshops as a research site can engage underserved individuals (i.e., due to class, race, or age status) or address personal concerns (e.g., health). As a way of exploring these issues, we conducted a series of five design workshops with low-income African-American older adults to understand their health experiences. Our findings reveal three insights associated with the design workshop and the topic of health: comfort with community versus personal health; the sociocultural configuration of interaction; and empowerment in the context of systematic inequality of opportunity. We discuss the importance of understanding the situated nature of design workshops, particularly when engaging underserved groups in the topic of health, and the potential of the design workshop as a mechanism for activism.},

Our findings suggest that support needs and structures of mothers evolve during transition, and that they also vary by socio-economic contexts. In this paper, we detail our study design and findings. Informed by our findings, we posit that all life-transitions are not the same, and that therefore, the optimal support intervention point varies for different life transitions. Currently there are no tools available to identify optimal support intervention points during life transitions. To this end, we also introduce a preliminary framework the Strength-Stress-Analysis (SSA) framework - to identify optimal support intervention points during life-transitions.},

We also found that as participants’ ICIs progressed, their goals, challenges, and social media use similarly evolved over time.

In Part 2, we visited three public or semi-public locations where we demonstrated sound feedback on the smartwatch in situ to examine contextual influences and explore sound filtering options. Our findings characterize uses for vibration in multimodal sound awareness, both for push notification and for immediately actionable sound information displayed through vibrational patterns (tactons). In situ experiences caused participants to request sound filtering—particularly to limit haptic feedback—as a method for managing soundscape complexity. Additional concerns arose related to learnability, possibility of distraction, and system trust. Our findings have implications for future portable sound awareness systems.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a qualitative study with 89 participants that details how abusers in intimate partner violence (IPV) contexts exploit technologies to intimidate, threaten, monitor, impersonate, harass, or otherwise harm their victims. We show that, at their core, many of the attacks in IPV contexts are technologically unsophisticated from the perspective of a security practitioner or researcher. For example, they are often carried out by a UI-bound adversary—an adversarial but authenticated user that interacts with a victim’s device or account via standard user interfaces—or by downloading and installing a ready-made application that enables spying on a victim. Nevertheless, we show how the sociotechnical and relational factors that characterize IPV make such attacks both extremely damaging to victims and challenging to counteract, in part because they undermine the predominant threat models under which systems have been designed. We discuss the nature of these new IPV threat models and outline opportunities for HCI research and design to mitigate these attacks.},

	abstract = {Physical activity (PA) is critical for reducing the risk of obesity, a prevalent health concern that burdens lowsocioeconomic status (SES) households. While self-tracking apps can increase PA, encouraging app engagement remains a challenge, thus limiting the app’s efficacy. To understand how to better support caregiver’s motivation to use family health apps, we designed and evaluated Storywell—a mobile app for promoting family PA. Guided by Self-Determination Theory, Storywell provides social rewards (e.g., storybooks with interactive reflective questions) aimed at supporting relatedness and motivation. Our 3-month qualitative study with 18 families revealed satisfying moments that can affect caregiver’s motivation. We contribute new knowledge on designing satisfying moments that heighten the motivation to use health apps, especially for low-SES families who face many barriers to using such systems.},

We report on a pilot deployment that helped refine the system, and a second deployment involving the installation of nine of each type of system within a large Mumbai slum for a 40-day period, resulting in over 12,000 queries. We present the findings from a detailed analysis and comparison of the two question-answer corpora; discuss how these insights might help improve machine-powered smart speakers; and, highlight the potential benefits of multi-sited public speech installations within slum environments.},

We detail four types of technologies trans people envision: technologies for changing bodies, technologies for changing appearances / gender expressions, technologies for safety, and technologies for ﬁnding resources. We found that centering trans people in the design process enabled inclusive technology design that primarily focused on sharing community resources and prioritized connection between community members.},

Within games, productive learning episodes can result from breakdowns when followed by a breakthrough, yet their role in children’s learning has not been investigated. This paper examines the role of game and instructional design during and after breakdowns. We observed 26 young children playing several popular learning games and conducted a moment-by-moment analysis of breakdown episodes. Our findings show children achieve productive breakthroughs independently less than half of the time. In particular, breakdowns caused by game actions are difficult for children to overcome independently and prevent engagement with the domain skills. Importantly, we identify specific instructional game components and their role in fostering strategies that result in successful breakthroughs. We conclude with intrinsic and extrinsic instructional design implications for both game designers and primary teachers to better enable children’s games-based learning.},

To do this, we recruited 260 Facebook users to install a Facebook application that surveyed their privacy concerns, their friend network compositions, the sensitivity of posted content, and their privacy-preserving strategies. By asking participants targeted questions about people randomly selected from their friend network and posts shared on their proﬁles, we were able to quantify the extent to which users trust their “friends” and the likelihood that their content was being viewed by unintended audiences. We found that while strangers are the most concerning audience, almost 95\% of our participants had taken steps to mitigate those concerns. At the same time, we observed that 16.5\% of participants had at least one post that they were uncomfortable sharing with a speciﬁc friend—someone who likely already had the ability to view it—and that 37\% raised more general concerns with sharing their content with friends. We conclude that the current privacy controls allow users to eﬀectively manage the outsider threat, but that they are unsuitable for mitigating concerns over the insider threat—members of the friend network who dynamically become inappropriate audiences based on the context of a post.},

This meter combines neural networks and numerous carefully combined heuristics to score passwords and generate data-driven text feedback about the user’s password. We describe the meter’s iterative development and ﬁnal design. We detail the security and usability impact of the meter’s design dimensions, examined through a 4,509-participant online study. Under the more common password-composition policy we tested, we found that the data-driven meter with detailed feedback led users to create more secure, and no less memorable, passwords than a meter with only a bar as a strength indicator.},

Since human users are independent agents who make their own choices, closing these vulnerabilities means persuading users to make different choices. Focusing on one speciﬁc human choice – clicking on a link in a phishing email – we conducted an experiment to identify better ways to train users to make more secure decisions. We compared traditional facts-and-advice training against training that uses a simple story to convey the same lessons. We found a surprising interaction effect: facts-and-advice training works better than not training users, but only when presented by a security expert. Stories don’t work quite as well as factsand-advice, but work much better when told by a peer. This suggests that the perceived origin of training materials can have a surprisingly large effect on security outcomes.},

During our ﬁeld study, users continued through a tenth of Mozilla Firefox’s malware and phishing warnings, a quarter of Google Chrome’s malware and phishing warnings, and a third of Mozilla Firefox’s SSL warnings. This demonstrates that security warnings can be effective in practice; security experts and system architects should not dismiss the goal of communicating security information to end users. We also ﬁnd that user behavior varies across warnings. In contrast to the other warnings, users continued through 70.2\% of Google Chrome’s SSL warnings.

During this effort, a large, diverse group of globally-distributed journalists met and maintained critical security goals–including protecting the source of the leaked documents and preserving the secrecy of the project until the desired launch date–all while hundreds of journalists collaborated remotely on a near-daily basis. Through survey data from 118 participating journalists, as well as in-depth, semi-structured interviews with the designers and implementers of the systems underpinning the collaboration, we investigate the factors that supported this effort. We ﬁnd that the tools developed for the project were both highly useful and highly usable, motivating journalists to use the secure communication platforms provided instead of seeking workarounds. We also found that, despite having little prior computer security experience, journalists adopted—and even appreciated—the strict security requirements imposed by the project leads. We also ﬁnd that a shared sense of community and responsibility contributed to participants’ motivation to meet and maintain security requirements. From these and other ﬁndings, we distill lessons for socio-technical systems with strong security requirements and identify opportunities for future work.},

	abstract = {Notifying users about a system’s data practices is supposed to enable users to make informed privacy decisions. Yet, current notice and choice mechanisms, such as privacy policies, are often ineﬀective because they are neither usable nor useful, and are therefore ignored by users. Constrained interfaces on mobile devices, wearables, and smart home devices connected in an Internet of Things exacerbate the issue. Much research has studied usability issues of privacy notices and many proposals for more usable privacy notices exist. Yet, there is little guidance for designers and developers on the design aspects that can impact the eﬀectiveness of privacy notices. In this paper, we make multiple contributions to remedy this issue. We survey the existing literature on privacy notices and identify challenges, requirements, and best practices for privacy notice design. Further, we map out the design space for privacy notices by identifying relevant dimensions. This provides a taxonomy and consistent terminology of notice approaches to foster understanding and reasoning about notice options available in the context of speciﬁc systems. Our systemization of knowledge and the developed design space can help designers, developers, and researchers identify notice and choice requirements and develop a comprehensive notice concept for their system that addresses the needs of diﬀerent audiences and considers the system’s limitations and opportunities for providing notice.},

Researchers have studied various aspects of online markets including motivations of consumer behaviors on online markets. However, due to the lack of log data of consumers’ online behaviors including their purchase, it has not been thoroughly investigated or validated on what drives consumers to purchase products on online markets. Our research moves forward from prior studies by analyzing consumers’ actual online behaviors that lead to actual purchases, and using datasets from multiple online shopping sites that can provide comparisons across diﬀerent types of online shopping sites. We analyzed consumers’ buying process and constructed consumers’ behavior trajectory to gain deeper understanding of consumer behaviors on online markets. We ﬁnd that a substantial portion (24\%) of consumers in a general-purpose marketplace (like eBay) discover items from external sources (e.g., price comparison sites), while most ({\textgreater}95\%) of consumers in a special-purpose shopping site directly access items from the site itself. We also reveal that item browsing patterns and cart usage patterns are the important predictors of the actual purchases. Using behavioral features identiﬁed by our analysis, we developed a prediction model to infer whether a consumer purchases item(s). Our prediction model of purchases achieved over 80\% accuracy across four diﬀerent online shopping sites.},

Moreover, the results show that the consumer’s Web experience has a positive and significant effect on the perceived richness of the online store and that the perceived risk related to the use of the online store has a negative and significant effect on the consumer’s trust in and attitude towards the online store.

	abstract = {High penetration of social media in Indonesia gives more opportunities for sellers to promote their products, as well as for consumers to buy. Instagram is a popular social media for ecommerce in Indonesia. In 2016 Instagram introduced the Call-toAction (CTA) buttons to trigger more e-commerce transactions on Instagram. On the other hand, impulse buying of social commerce consumers can be explained by the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the impact of the CTA buttons on consumers’ impulse buying using the S-O-R model. A questionnaire was administered to collect data from 163 consumers. The data were analyzed and tested using Partial Least Squares (PLS). The results were validated by interviews with 3 sellers and 3 consumers. It shows that the CTA buttons have a positive impact on consumers’ impulsive purchase, but less effective to improve consumers’ perceived enjoyment. The main contribution of this study is the understanding of consumers' impulse buying response on promotional ads feature, which is related to the CTA buttons.},

The tasks were to visit the website and view the product until the participant was satisfied, then clicked the stop button. The objective measure collected time spent on websites with each product presentation format. The subjective measures collected the participants' opinions using 5-point Likert scale questionnaires on six aspects, and one fill-in-the-blank question on the participants’ predicted product prices. The product presentation formats had a significant effect on the objective measure, time spent on website. The product presentation formats also had significant effects on the subjective measures of opinions on the product presentation format, usability and user experience; perceived amount of information; trust; attitude toward the product, brand, and website; overall satisfaction; and purchase intention. In addition, the product presentation formats had a significant effect on the predicted product price.},

The results show that external factors and internal factors influence online compulsive buying behavior through mediating variables (self-control and negative emotions). The role of internal factors is more powerful than the role of external factors. All variables of the internal factors have a positive influence on negative emotions, and all variables of the external factors have a negative influence on self-control. This paper propose suggestions to reduce consumers' online compulsive buying behavior. The research conclusion provides a reference and guidance for future research on consumer behavior and psychology.},

	abstract = {The emergence of Facebook (FB) Live has provided a new opportunity for online vendors to sell products and services in real time. In developing countries like Thailand, vendors exploit this FB feature to make buyers feel like shopping at the store. Through real time buying, buyers are usually urged to buy impulsively. To better understand what factors influence Thai consumers to buy impulsively through FB Live, this study interviewed eight buyers who have purchase experience via FB Live. The factors found from the semi-structured in-depth interviews can be categorized into two groups: vendor and buyer. In terms of vendors, factors are related to vendors‟ characteristics and business strategies, for example, reputation, interactivity, hedonic efforts, and price advantage). On the buyer side, this study focuses on the perceptions of buyers (i.e. perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and perceived crowding). The conceptual model has also been proposed to empirically test the constructs of the proposed model. The findings may help vendors in other countries to conduct C2C s-commerce effectively. Implications and future works are also discussed.},

A group of people who have the same need buy products online together, taking advantage of numbers to get bargains. Website stickiness, the website’s ability to retain online customers and prolong the duration of each stay, is one of the key factors to e-commerce success. How to maintain members’ stickiness becomes a critical issue in Information Systems (IS) study. Therefore, we aim to explore members’ stickiness intention by linking justice theory and trust. The research model is based on Social cognition theory (SCT) and trust related literature. This study posits trust in marketplace, trust in initiator, and conformity as environmental influences, while collective efficacy is viewed as personal influences. We validate that member perceived distributive justice, procedure justice, and interactional justice have impact on their trust in marketplace and trust in initiator. Besides, member’s perceived trust, conformity, and collective efficacy have influence on their stickiness intention.},

However, e-marketing is challenging and growing trend to incline the consumers due to the rapid diffusion of the technology. The core objective of this study is to investigate the effect of “e-marketing” on online consumer buying behavior in the context of the Pakistan. Data were collected through questionnaires distribution among 800 online users from November 2015 to June 2016. Later, 726 questionnaires were found valid for further analysis, addressed 90\% accuracy in the response rate. In order to test the research hypotheses, structural equation modeling (SEM) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) were employed. It is revealed that electronic marketing (eM) is significantly correlated to the online consumer buying behavior in the context of Pakistan. The findings of the research also indicated a positive relationship of each subitems of the e-marketing, as independently analyzed. Moreover, this study proposes certain managerial implications along with possible future work for academic researchers and practitioners.},

Increasingly, consumer activity is moving to the web, where digital receipts of online purchases provide valuable data sources detailing consumer behavior. We consider such data extracted from emails and combined with with consumers’ demographic information, which we use to characterize, model, and predict purchasing behavior. We analyze such behavior of consumers in different age and gender groups, and ﬁnd interesting, actionable patterns that can be used to improve ad targeting systems. For example, we found that the amount of money spent on online purchases grows sharply with age, peaking in the late 30s, while shoppers from wealthy areas tend to purchase more expensive items and buy them more frequently. Furthermore, we look at the inﬂuence of social connections on purchasing habits, as well as at the temporal dynamics of online shopping where we discovered daily and weekly behavioral patterns. Finally, we build a model to predict when shoppers are most likely to make a purchase and how much will they spend, showing improvement over baseline approaches. The presented results paint a clear picture of a modern online shopper, and allow better understanding of consumer behavior that can help improve marketing efforts and make shopping more pleasant and efﬁcient experience for online customers.},

Third-party proxy websites negotiate with merchants for appealing deals and then provide them to end customers. We call it online group buying. Besides, there exists local group buying where the joiners, the initiator, and sometimes even the merchants are in the same local community. Such locality induces some interesting characteristics in group buying, which remain largely unexplored in the research community. This study attempts to reveal users’ behaviors in group buying within the local context. We developed a mobile service called “HappyGo” that supports local group buying. We conducted a trial involving more than 300 users from a company office. From our findings, we believe that local group buying complements online group buying by creating a “local” economic circle while also providing users with social benefits.},

	abstract = {Recommender system has become an important component in modern eCommerce. Recent research on recommender systems has been mainly concentrating on improving the relevance or proﬁtability of individual recommended items. But in reality, users are usually exposed to a set of items and they may buy multiple items in one single order. Thus, the relevance or proﬁtability of one item may actually depend on the other items in the set. In other words, the set of recommendations is a bundle with items interacting with each other. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem called the Bundle Recommendation Problem (BRP). By solving the BRP, we are able to ﬁnd the optimal bundle of items to recommend with respect to preferred business objective. However, BRP is a large-scale NP-hard problem. We then show that it may be suﬃcient to solve a signiﬁcantly smaller version of BRP depending on properties of input data. This allows us to solve BRP in real-world applications with millions of users and items. Both oﬄine and online experimental results on a Walmart.com demonstrate the incremental value of solving BRP across multiple baseline models.},

In recent research, in conjunction with user feedback, the appearance of a product as side information has been shown to be helpful for learning product embedding. However, since a product has a variety of aspects such as functionality and speciﬁcations, taking into account only its appearance as side information does not suﬃce to accurately learn its embedding. In this paper, we propose a matrix co-factorization method that leverages information hidden in the so-called “also-viewed” products, i.e., a list of products that has also been viewed by users who have viewed a target product. “Also-viewed” products reﬂect various aspects of a given product that have been overlooked by visually-aware recommendation methods proposed in past research. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of user rating prediction. We also perform classiﬁcation on the product embedding learned by our method, and compare it with a state-of-the-art baseline to demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating high-quality product embedding that better represents the product.},

In this paper, by bridging consumer behavior with perceived stimuli on social networks, we present a computational framework, termed Consumer Impulsivity Model (CIM), for exploring a consumer’s impulsivity in both ofﬂine and online context: consumption-related location visit indicating consumption patterns in the physical realm, and online shopping behavior indicating economic activities on the Internet. To demonstrate the effectiveness of CIM, we conduct extensive experiments, with a large dataset we have collected from thousands of consumers. The results show that 1) for 103 subjects, the inferred consumer impulsivity has a positive Pearson correlation with survey results in the situation of product and product category, respectively. 2) females inferred impulsivity is higher than males on average in the situation of product and product category, respectively. Age has a negative Pearson correlation with inferred impulsivity in the situation of POI, POI category and product category, respectively. 3) for next behavior prediction, our model defeats several presented baselines. These results suggest that our framework CIM offers a powerful paradigm for 1) presenting an effective measurement for consumer impulsivity. 2) uncovering the correlation between consumer impulsivity and demographic factors and 3) revealing that the introduction of impulsivity is effective in predicting consumer behavior.},

This kind of newly-appeared malicious activity proposes challenges to traditional search spam detection e orts because it involves the participation of many crowd workers who are normal online shopping users in most of the times, and these activities are composed of a series of behaviors including search, browse, click and add to favorites.},

To address this, we describe an interview study that investigates the friendship networks of people who participate in group-shopping sites (e.g., Groupon) with the goal of understanding how to best design for these experiences. Our results show that group-shopping sites are predominently used to support social activities; that is, users do not use them first and foremost to find ‘deals.’ Instead, group-shopping sites are used for planning group activities, extending and building friendships, and constructing one’s social identity. Based on these findings, we suggest improved social network integration and impression management tools to improve user experience within group-shopping sites.},

	abstract = {Consumer product reviews are the backbone of commerce online. Most commonly, sites ask users for their personal opinions on a product or service. I conjecture, however, that this traditional method of eliciting reviews often invites idiosyncratic viewpoints. In this paper, I present a statistical study examining the differences between traditionally elicited product ratings (i.e., “How do you rate this product?”) and social inference ratings (i.e., “How do you think other people will rate this product?”). In 5 of 6 trials, I ﬁnd that social inference ratings produce the same aggregate product rating as the one produced via traditionally elicited ratings. In all cases, however, social inferences yield less variance. This is signiﬁcant because using social inference ratings 1) therefore converges on the true aggregate product rating faster, and 2) is a cheap design intervention on the part of existing sites.},

Against the gap or import models that sometimes limit HCI understandings of computational change in non-Western environments, we argue that the consumers, business owners, delivery drivers, and call center staff play active and formative roles in producing this infrastructure, integrating new tools into older cultural practices and determining how they work within the limits and conventions of the environment. We argue that resourceful and imaginative activities such as these constitute a form of creative infrastructural action and are central to the ways that new tools circulate in the world, though they often go unrecognized by HCI as innovation.},

We utilized tweeted URLs to generate a domain network, connecting domains shared by the same user, then conducted qualitative analysis to understand the nature of different domains and how they connect to each other. Our findings demonstrate how alternative news sites propagate and shape alternative narratives, while mainstream media deny them. We explain how political leanings of alternative news sites do not align well with a U.S. left-right spectrum, but instead feature an antiglobalist (vs. globalist) orientation where U.S. Alt-Right sites look similar to U.S. Alt-Left sites. Our findings describe a subsection of the emerging alternative media ecosystem and provide insight in how websites that promote conspiracy theories and pseudo-science may function to conduct underlying political agendas.},

Leaning on several theoretical frameworks, but in particular Nissenbaum’s notion of contextual integrity, we question the viability of obtaining universal answers in terms of people’s ‘general’ privacy practices and apply elements of Nissenbaum’s theory to our own data in order to illustrate its relevance.

While the extant literature suggests that drones can in principle invade people’s privacy, little is known about how people actually think about drones. Drawing from a series of in-depth interviews conducted in the United States, we provide a novel and rich account of people’s privacy perceptions of drones for civilian uses both in general and under speciﬁc usage scenarios. Our informants raised both physical and information privacy issues against government, organization and individual use of drones. Informants’ reasoning about the acceptance of drone use was in part based on whether the drone is operating in a public or private space. However, our informants differed signiﬁcantly in their deﬁnitions of public and private spaces. While our informants’ privacy concerns such as surveillance, data collection and sharing have been raised for other tracking technologies such as camera phones and closed-circuit television (CCTV), our interviews highlight two heightened issues of drones: (1) powerful yet inconspicuous data collection, (2) hidden and inaccessible drone controllers. These two aspects of drones render some of people’s existing privacy practices futile (e.g., notice recording and ask controllers to stop or delete the recording). Some informants demanded notiﬁcations of drones near them and expected drone controllers asking for their explicit permissions before recording. We discuss implications for future privacy-enhancing drone designs.},

It was also demonstrated that perceived realism of fake news is stronger among individuals with high exposure to fake news and low exposure to hard news than among those with high exposure to both fake and hard news.

Tuenti, the largest OSN in Spain, dedicates 14 full-time employees in that task alone, incurring a signiﬁcant monetary cost.

In this paper, we characterized a dataset of 4.4 million public posts generated on Facebook during 17 news-making events (natural calamities, terror attacks, etc.) and identiﬁed 11,217 malicious posts containing URLs. We found that most of the malicious content which is currently evading Facebook’s detection techniques originated from third party and web applications, while more than half of all legitimate content originated from mobile applications. We also observed greater participation of Facebook pages in generating malicious content as compared to legitimate content. We proposed an extensive feature set based on entity proﬁle, textual content, metadata, and URL features to automatically identify malicious content on Facebook in real time. This feature set was used to train multiple machine learning models and achieved an accuracy of 86.9\%. We performed experiments to show that past techniques for spam campaign detection identiﬁed less than half the number of malicious posts as compared to our model. This model was used to create a REST API and a browser plug-in to identify malicious Facebook posts in real time.},

They are responsible for a growing number of threats, including fake product reviews, malware and spam on social networks, and astroturf political campaigns. Unfortunately, studies show that existing tools such as CAPTCHAs and graph-based Sybil detectors have not proven to be effective defenses. In this paper, we describe our work on building a practical system for detecting fake identities using server-side clickstream models. We develop a detection approach that groups “similar” user clickstreams into behavioral clusters, by partitioning a similarity graph that captures distances between clickstream sequences. We validate our clickstream models using ground-truth traces of 16,000 real and Sybil users from Renren, a large Chinese social network with 220M users. We propose a practical detection system based on these models, and show that it provides very high detection accuracy on our clickstream traces. Finally, we worked with collaborators at Renren and LinkedIn to test our prototype on their server-side data. Following positive results, both companies have expressed strong interest in further experimentation and possible internal deployment.},

Using a multi-methods and multinational approach, we investigated Facebook users’ privacy behavior by focusing on how they co-manage private information. Our findings from focus-group interviews (n = 28) and online surveys (n = 299) suggest that Facebook users primarily apply four different practices of privacy management: collaborative strategies, corrective strategies, preventive strategies, and information control. The four dimensions of privacy management display selective relationships with theoretical antecedents (e.g., self-efficacy, collective-efficacy, attitudes, privacy concern), indicating that each behavior is motivated by a different combination of conditions. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

To mitigate this problem, we have developed an Intelligent Privacy Assistant for Facebook that partially automates the assignment of sharing permissions, taking into account the content of the information published and user’s high-level sharing policies. The Assistant uses a novel social web privacy language, employs named entity recognition algorithms to annotate sensitive parts of published information and an answer set programming system to evaluate user’s privacy policies and determine the list of safe recipients. On a test scenario, the Assistant reached 73.8\% and 95.2\% performance in correctly determining safe and unsafe recipients, respectively.},

To address these problems, we propose two new interface designs for third-party apps’ authentication dialogs to: i) increase user control of apps' data access and restrict apps' publishing ability during the process of adding them to users’ profiles, and ii) alert users when their global privacy settings on Facebook are violated by apps. This research provides both conceptual and empirical insights in terms of design recommendations to address privacy concerns toward third-party apps on Facebook.},

In this paper, we examine whether or not privacy settings, privacy policies, and terms of service pages have been translated into each language available on ﬁve popular, global social networks: Facebook, Flickr, Google+, LinkedIn, and Twitter. We ﬁnd large diﬀerences across sites in the availability of translated privacy pages. Some sites, such as Google+, oﬀer privacy pages in a range of languages. In contrast, Facebook and Twitter’s privacy policies have been fully translated for only 14-15\% of the languages in which the sites are oﬀered. Since “notice” is a core principle of privacy, we argue that social media users who don’t speak English are not aﬀorded complete privacy rights. We further assert that it should be the responsibility of the social networks, not the crowd, to ensure that privacy information is fully translated.},

To do this, we recruited 260 Facebook users to install a Facebook application that surveyed their privacy concerns, their friend network compositions, the sensitivity of posted content, and their privacy-preserving strategies. By asking participants targeted questions about people randomly selected from their friend network and posts shared on their proﬁles, we were able to quantify the extent to which users trust their “friends” and the likelihood that their content was being viewed by unintended audiences. We found that while strangers are the most concerning audience, almost 95\% of our participants had taken steps to mitigate those concerns. At the same time, we observed that 16.5\% of participants had at least one post that they were uncomfortable sharing with a speciﬁc friend—someone who likely already had the ability to view it—and that 37\% raised more general concerns with sharing their content with friends. We conclude that the current privacy controls allow users to eﬀectively manage the outsider threat, but that they are unsuitable for mitigating concerns over the insider threat—members of the friend network who dynamically become inappropriate audiences based on the context of a post.},

Our research reveals several possible causes of why users make posts that they later regret: (1) they want to be perceived in favorable ways, (2) they do not think about their reason for posting or the consequences of their posts, (3) they misjudge the culture and norms within their social circles, (4) they are in a “hot” state of high emotion when posting, or under the inﬂuence of drugs or alcohol, (5) their postings are seen by an unintended audience, (6) they do not foresee how their posts could be perceived by people within their intended audience, and (7) they misunderstand or misuse the Facebook platform. Some reported incidents had serious repercussions, such as breaking up relationships or job losses.

Historically, research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD), and related disciplines has focused on the design and development of new interventions or technologies. As a result, the repair of old or broken technologies has been an often neglected topic of research. The goal of our work is to improve the practices surrounding the repair of digital artifacts in developing countries. Specifically, in this paper we examine the privacy challenges associated with the process of repairing digital artifacts, which usually requires that the owner of a broken artifact hand over the technology to a repairer. Findings from our ethnographic work conducted at 10 repair markets in Dhaka, Bangladesh, show a variety of ways in which the privacy of an individual’s personal data may be compromised during the repair process. We also examine people’s perceptions around privacy in repair and its connections with broader social and cultural values. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for future research to strengthen the repair ecosystem in developing countries. Taken together, our findings contribute to the growing discourse around post-use cycles of technology in ICTD and HCI.},

We conducted a novel exploratory survey (conducted on Facebook as a Platform app) to measure how Facebook app users interact with apps, what they understand about how apps access and exchange their profile information, and how these factors relate to their privacy concerns. In our analysis, we paid special attention to our most knowledgeable respondents: given their expertise, would they differ in behaviors or attitudes from less knowledgeable respondents? We found that misunderstandings and confusion abound about how apps function and how they manage profile data. Against our expectations, knowledge or behavior weren’t consistent predictors of privacy concerns with third-party apps or on SNSs in general. Instead, whether or not the respondent experienced an adverse privacy event on a social networking site was a reliable predictor of privacy attitudes.},

	abstract = {Users are sharing and consuming enormous amounts of information through online social network interaction every day. Yet, many users struggle to control what they share to their overlapping social spheres. Google+ introduces circles, a mechanism that enables users to group friends and use these groups to control their social network feeds and posts. We present the results of a qualitative interview study on the sharing perceptions and behavior of 27 Google+ users. These results indicate that many users have a clear understanding of circles, using them to target information to those most interested in it. Yet, despite these positive perceptions, there is only moderate use of circles to control information ﬂow. We explore reasons and risks associated with these behaviors and provide insight on the impact and open questions of this privacy mechanism.},

	abstract = {Technology developers continue to develop new information and communication technologies (ICTs) aimed at addressing longstanding problems in international development. However, the sheer number of unsuccessful projects shows the importance of better understanding the ways in which a given population uses technology, before attempting to build novel applications for that population. We argue that this means adopting a methodological approach that recognizes that ideas develop slowly over time. As a first step in realizing this process, we present results from an exploratory qualitative study of mobile phone and social media use among residents of an informal settlement, or “slum”, in Nairobi, Kenya. Our fieldwork reveals how contextual factors unique to slum environments affect mobile phone ownership and Internet access. We use these findings to propose an alternative approach to design, which accounts for the realities of living in a slum, and engages with residents. We also address the need for greater reflexivity in ICTD research.},

This study systematically examines cultural differences in collective privacy management strategies, and highlights methodological precautions that must be taken in quantitative intercultural privacy research. Using survey data of 498 Facebook users from the US, Singapore, and South Korea, we test the validity and cultural invariance of the measurement model and predictive model associated with collective privacy management. The results show that the measurement model is only partially culturally invariant, indicating that social media users in different countries interpret the same instruments in different ways. Also, cross-national comparisons of the structural model show that causal pathways from collective privacy management strategies to privacy-related outcomes vary significantly across countries. The findings suggest significant cultural variations in privacy management practices, both with regard to the conceptualization of its theoretical constructs, and with respect to causal pathways.},

In our system, a worker’s feedback remains hidden in an aggregate form but at the end the actual scenario of the workplace could be revealed. Thus, our system protects workers from facing troubles and losing jobs for sharing their suﬀerings to the public. On the other hand, the revealed feedback can motivate the management authority to improve the quality of their workplaces in the fear of losing trust and reputation. We propose two techniques: in one technique, workers in cooperation with the server hide their individual feedback from other and in other technique, workers protect their privacy in a crowdsourced manner. We show a comparative analysis of our techniques with experiments.},

However, only few researches to date have tested these correlations empirically, showing how users’ self-disclosure practices and digital privacy concerns interact with their anticipated benefits of social capital. To address this issue, an online survey was conducted, administrated to the staff of the University of the Aegean in Greece. The findings indicate that Facebook intensity use, selfdisclosure and social capital are positively associated; privacy concerns affect users’ disclosure though social capital benefits effect is greater.},

For example, Facebook users determine which audiences have access to their profile information and posts, how friends can interact with them through tagging, and how others can search for them—and many more privacy tasks. In most cases, the default privacy settings are permissive and appear to be designed to promote information sharing rather than privacy. Managing privacy online can be complex and often users do not change defaults or use granular privacy settings. In this article, we investigate whether default privacy settings on social network sites could be more customized to the preferences of users. We survey users' privacy attitudes and sharing preferences for common SNS profile items. From these data, we explore using audience characterizations of profile items to quantify fit scores that indicate how well default privacy settings represent user privacy preferences. We then explore the fit of various schemes, including examining whether privacy attitude segmentation can be used to improve default settings. Our results suggest that using audience characterizations from community data to create default privacy settings can better match users' desired privacy settings.},

But such technologies also pose threats to "group privacy," which is a concept scholars know relatively little about. Moreover, there are few tools to address the problem of protecting group privacy. This paper discusses an emerging class of software applications and services that pose new risks to group privacy by revealing group-level information based on individual information, such as social media postings or fitness app usage. The paper describes the results of two experiments that empirically establish the concept of group privacy and shows that it affects user perceptions of and interactions with information technology. The findings serve as a call to developers to design tools for group privacy protection.},

	abstract = {Background: Social networks have changed the way people communicate. Business processes and social interactions revolve more in the cyber space. However, as these cyber technologies advance, users become more exposed to privacy threats. Regulatory frameworks and legal instruments currently lacking a strong cyber presence are required, for the protection of users.
Objectives: There is need to explore and evaluate the extent to which users are exposed to vulnerabilities and threats in the context of the existing protection laws and policies. Furthermore, to investigate how the existing legal instruments can be enhanced to better protect users.
Method: This article evaluates and analyses these privacy challenges from a legalistic point of view. The study is focused on the South African Facebook users. Poll information gathered from the profile pages of users at North-West University was analysed. A short survey was also conducted to validate the poll results. Descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency and measures of spread, have been used to present the data. In addition, a combination of tabulated and graphical description data was also summarised in a meaningful way.
Results: The results clearly show that the legal frameworks and laws are still evolving and that they are not adequately drafted to deal with specific cyber violation of privacy.
Conclusion: This highlights the need to review legal instruments on a regular basis with wider consultation with users in an endeavour to develop a robust and an enforceable legal framework. A proactive legal framework would be the ideal approach unfortunately; law is reactive to cyber-crimes.},

Also, the existing privacy settings are not flexible enough to prevent privacy risks. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Privacy Settings Model (PSM) that can lead users to understand, control, and update SNSs’ privacy settings.

However, researchers have tended to study social media usage in developed countries and focused less on privacy concerns. Yet, to properly tailor social media privacy settings to the needs of users in less well-resourced settings, we need to study users in a wider range of settings. In this study, we show how mobile social media users in South Africa are making use of the privacy settings and controls on social media platforms. We present findings from interviews of 52 current mobile social media users in South Africa, ranging from low-income users to upper-middle class users. Several themes emerged. First, users’ primary privacy-related concern was who else could see their posts and messages, not what data the platforms collect about them. Second, users displayed general knowledge gaps on both existing social media privacy settings and data collection efforts by advertisers. Third, users’ considerations for their own physical safety often shaped their attitudes towards privacy online. Fourth, usage of privacy settings and conceptions of privacy are heavily swayed by offline social factors, such as perceived intimacy of a platform and information sharing amongst friends.

	abstract = {Social media usage is widespread globally, and continues to grow in developing countries. However, researchers have tended to study social media usage in developed countries and focused less on privacy concerns. Yet, to properly tailor social media privacy settings to the needs of users in less well-resourced settings, we need to study users in a wider range of settings. In this study, we show how mobile social media users in South Africa are making use of the privacy settings and controls on social media platforms. We present findings from interviews of 52 current mobile social media users in South Africa, ranging from low-income users to upper-middle class users. Several themes emerged. First, users’ primary privacy-related concern was who else could see their posts and messages, not what data the platforms collect about them. Second, users displayed general knowledge gaps on both existing social media privacy settings and data collection efforts by advertisers. Third, users’ considerations for their own physical safety often shaped their attitudes towards privacy online.

In a 63-participant longitudinal study, participants gave their audience and emphasis preferences for up to ten of their Facebook posts in the week they were posted, again one week later, and again one month later. In a 234-participant retrospective study, participants expressed their preferences about posts made in the past week, as well as one year prior. We found that participants did not want content to fade away wholesale with age; the audience participants wanted to be able to access posts remained relatively constant over time. However, participants did want a handful of posts to become more private over time, as well as others to become more visible. Participants’ predictions about how their preferences would change correlated poorly with their actual changes in preferences over time, casting doubt on ideas for setting an expiration date for content. Although older posts were seen as less relevant and had often been forgotten, participants found value in these posts for reminiscence. Surprisingly, we observed few concerns about privacy or self-presentation for older posts. We discuss our ﬁndings’ implications for retrospective privacy mechanisms.},

Therefore, OSN friends are potentially jeopardizing users’ privacy. Previous studies demonstrated that third parties can potentially infer personally identiﬁable information (PII) based on information shared by users’ OSN friends if suﬃcient information is accessible. However, when considering how privacy settings have been adjusted since then, it is unclear which attributes can still be predicted this way. In this paper, we present an empirical study on PII of Facebook users and their friends. We show that certain pieces of PII can easily be inferred. In contrast, other attributes are rarely made publicly available and/or correlate too little so that not enough information is revealed for intruding user privacy. For this study, we analyzed more than 1.2 million OSN proﬁles in a compliant manner to investigate the privacy risk due to attribute prediction by third parties. The data shown in this paper provides the basis for acting in a risk aware fashion in OSNs.},

The results indicated that there are usability violations that hinder this group from adjusting privacy settings, compromising its privacy and security on OSNs.

We found that older adult social media users and non-users shared similar privacy concerns; the most often mentioned being a concern for unauthorized access to personal information, and information misuse. While older adult non-users of social media protected themselves by avoiding social media, older adults who were social media users protected themselves by limiting the information they shared. This study has policy implications for training programs geared toward older adults and informs understandings of privacy literacy across the lifespan.},

The privacy dilemmas associated with personalized services are particularly concerning in the context of social networking websites, wherein the privacy dichotomy problem is widely observed. To prevent potential privacy violations, businesses need to employ multiple safeguards beyond the current privacy settings of users. As a possible solution, companies can utilize user social footprints to detect user privacy preferences. To take a step towards this goal, we first ran a series of experiments to examine if the privacy preference attribute is homophilous in social media. As a result, we found a set of clues that users’ privacy preferences are similar to the privacy behaviour of their social contacts, signaling that privacy homophily exists in social networks. We further studied users located in different neighbourhoods with varying degrees of privacy and found a set of characteristics that are specific to public users located in private neighbourhoods. These identified features can be used in a predictive model to identify public user accounts that are intended to be private, supporting companies to make an informed decision whether or not to exploit one’s publicly available data for personalization purposes.},

It seems, however, that informed use of the existing privacy options by the social network participants may alleviate - or even prevent - some of the more drastic privacyaverse incidents. Unfortunately, recent surveys show that an average user is either not aware of these options or does not use them, probably due to their perceived complexity. It is therefore reasonable to believe that tools assisting users with two tasks: 1) understanding their social network behavior in terms of their privacy settings and broad privacy categories, and 2) recommending reasonable privacy options, will be a valuable tool for everyday privacy practice in a social network context.

This paper aims to synthesize these two research areas and asks: Do regretful experiences on social media influence people to (consider) not using social media? How might this influence differ for different sorts of regretful experiences? We adopted a mixed methods approach, combining topic modeling, logistic regressions, and contingency analysis to analyze data from a web survey with a demographically representative sample of US internet users (n=515) focusing on their Facebook use. We found that experiences that arise because of users’ own actions influence actual deactivation of their Facebook account, while experiences that arise because of others’ actions lead to considerations of non-use. We discuss the implications of these findings for two theoretical areas of interest in HCI: individual agency in social media use and the networked dimensions of privacy.},

Facebook is currently the largest online social network; its business model is based on the analysis of user data to display customized advertisements. However, the data collection induces possible privacy concerns which oppose perceived benefits. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyze the discrepancy between possible privacy concerns and expected benefits and its effect on the users’ intention to participate in Facebook. For that purpose, a structural equation model is developed to explain the role of information disclosure and privacy concerns. We show that people use Facebook despite information privacy concerns. On closer examination information privacy concerns are an important aspect for the intention (not) to use Facebook but it is outweighed by perceived usefulness.},

	abstract = {Connectivity in social and economic spheres using mobile technology is a global phenomenon. This kind of communication is more significant for Southern Countries: a mean to develop, a way to come out of poverty, and a path towards an equitable society. This relationship between new communication technologies and society is complex, primarily due to their multidimensional effects in personal and social lives. Absence of a proper policy guideline and infrastructure to nurture the mobile communications’ potentials can leave the users at risk of privacy violations in an increasingly flattened world. Youths of the developing societies, who have a very high representation in ICT usage hence face greater risks in terms of privacy violation and involuntary personal data commodification. This paper, as a part of a multi-year study, specifically looks into the vulnerability of Bangladeshi youth population using mobile devices, for voice and data communications. Bangladesh, one of the emerging economies in South Asia, has a thriving Telecom/ICT industry with an ever growing number of users, majority of them being young. Based on a nationwide representative survey, we have found the level of trust on existing mobile telephony to be significantly higher than the Internet across the country among all respondents, amid the absence of any clear privacy and security framework at the national level. This paper moreover shows that a significant number of the younger generation (both male and female) are unaware about the concept of privacy in the ‘Digital Age’ and also have little or no idea about possible risks involved with sharing any voice or data communication.},

The results show that personal network size was positively associated with information revelation, no association was found between concern about unwanted audiences and information revelation and finally, students’ Internet privacy concerns and information revelation were negatively associated. The privacy protection strategies employed most often were the exclusion of personal information, the use of private email messages, and altering the default privacy settings.

	abstract = {The booming of social networks has given rise to a large volume of user-generated contents (UGCs), most of which are free and publicly available. A lot of users’ personal aspects can be extracted from these UGCs to facilitate personalized applications as validated by many previous studies. Despite their value, UGCs can place users at high privacy risks, which thus far remains largely untapped. Privacy is defined as the individual’s ability to control what information is disclosed, to whom, when and under what circumstances. As people and information both play significant roles, privacy has been elaborated as a boundary regulation process, where individuals regulate interaction with others by altering the openness degree of themselves to others. In this paper, we aim to reduce users’ privacy risks on social networks by answering the question of Who Can See What. Towards this goal, we present a novel scheme, comprising of descriptive, predictive and prescriptive components. In particular, we first collect a set of posts and extract a group of privacy-oriented features to describe the posts. We then propose a novel taxonomy-guided multi-task learning model to predict which personal aspects are uncovered by the posts. Lastly, we construct standard guidelines by the user study with 400 users to regularize users’ actions for preventing their privacy leakage. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset well verified our scheme.},

Results indicate the dominance of frames related to horizontal privacy, or privacy vis-à-vis peers, over vertical privacy (i.e., that from institutions and governments).

These findings suggest that user conceptualization of privacy reflects a cognate-based approach that emphasizes control and limits to information access.},

In this research, we aim to address some critical issues related to privacy protection: Would the highest privacy settings guarantee a secure protection? Given the open nature of social networking sites, is it possible to manage one’s privacy protection? With the diversity of one’s social media friends, how can one ﬁgure out an eﬀective approach to balance between vulnerability and privacy? We present a novel way to deﬁne a vulnerable friend from an individual user’s perspective is dependent on whether or not the user’s friends’ privacy settings protect the friend and the individual’s network of friends (which includes the user). As a single vulnerable friend in a user’s social network might place all friends at risk, we resort to experiments and observe how much security an individual user can improve by unfriending a vulnerable friend. We also show how privacy weakens if newly accepted friends are unguarded or unprotected. This work provides a large-scale evaluation of new security and privacy indexes using a Facebook dataset. We present and discuss a new perspective for reasoning about social networking security. When a user accepts a new friend, the user should ensure that the new friend is not an increased security risk with the potential of negatively impacting the entire friend network. Additionally, by leveraging the indexes proposed and employing new strategies for unfriending vulnerable friends, it is possible to further improve security and privacy without changing the social networking site’s existing architecture.},

We map this problem to a relational classiﬁcation problem and we propose practical models that use friendship and group membership information (which is often not hidden) to infer sensitive attributes. The key novel idea is that in addition to friendship links, groups can be carriers of signiﬁcant information. We show that on several well-known social media sites, we can easily and accurately recover the information of private-proﬁle users.

Contrary to expectations, we find that content type is not a significant predictor of privacy setting; however, some demographics such as gender and age are predictive.

In this paper, we survey existing literature on cross-cultural privacy issues, giving particular weight to work speciﬁc to online social networking sites. We then propose a framework for evaluating the extent to which social networking sites’ privacy options are offered and communicated in a manner that supports diverse users from around the world. One aspect of our framework focuses on cultural issues, such as norms regarding the use of pseudonyms or posting of photographs. A second aspect of our framework discusses legal issues in cross-cultural privacy, including data-protection requirements and questions of jurisdiction. The ﬁnal part of our framework delves into user expectations regarding the data-sharing practices and the communication of privacy information. The framework can enable service providers to identify potential gaps in support for user privacy. It can also help researchers, regulators, or consumer advocates reason systematically about cultural differences related to privacy in social media.},

	abstract = {Online display advertising on websites is widely disliked by users, with many turning to ad blockers to avoid “bad” ads. Recent evidence suggests that today’s ads contain potentially problematic content, in addition to well-studied concerns about the privacy and intrusiveness of ads. However, we lack knowledge of which types of ad content users consider problematic and detrimental to their browsing experience. Our work bridges this gap: frst, we create a taxonomy of 15 positive and negative user reactions to online advertising from a survey of 60 participants. Second, we characterize classes of online ad content that users dislike or fnd problematic, using a dataset of 500 ads crawled from popular websites, labeled by 1000 participants using our taxonomy. Among our fndings, we report that users consider a substantial amount of ads on the web today to be clickbait, untrustworthy, or distasteful, including ads for software downloads, listicles, and health \& supplements.},

	abstract = {In order to evaluate the prevalence of security and privacy practices on a representative sample of the Web, researchers rely on website popularity rankings such as the Alexa list. While the validity and representativeness of these rankings are rarely questioned, our ﬁndings show the contrary: we show for four main rankings how their inherent properties (similarity, stability, representativeness, responsiveness and benignness) affect their composition and therefore potentially skew the conclusions made in studies. Moreover, we ﬁnd that it is trivial for an adversary to manipulate the composition of these lists. We are the ﬁrst to empirically validate that the ranks of domains in each of the lists are easily altered, in the case of Alexa through as little as a single {HTTP} request. This allows adversaries to manipulate rankings on a large scale and insert malicious domains into whitelists or bend the outcome of research studies to their will. To overcome the limitations of such rankings, we propose improvements to reduce the ﬂuctuations in list composition and guarantee better defenses against manipulation. To allow the research community to work with reliable and reproducible rankings, we provide {TRANCO}, an improved ranking that we offer through an online service available at https://tranco-list.eu.},
